== Purpose ==
The purpose of this page is to gather questions for the MD-SAL team that can be used to help guide the MD-SAL deep dive meetings. Some of these questions / answers should eventually make their way into the [[OpenDaylight_Controller:MD-SAL:Developer_FAQ|MD-SAL developer FAQ]]. So if you have a question please tack it onto the end with a '#'.

# What is the sequence from a RESTCONF request down to an RPC implementation invocation, including the serialization / deserialization of data assuming an binding dependent RPC implementation?
# What is the best practices you have found for debugging / tracing the serialization (javaassit) code? Or can we get rid of it?
# What is the best practices you have found for debugging / tracing the xtend code? Or can we get rid of it?
# Is there a standard way to provide notifications back to a RESTCONF (or other) client when a config data change or a callback associated with a config change fails? The example here is when something like a Flow is pushed but fails when being configured on a device for any reasons (such as connectivity) how do we alert a client or a GUI? In ODL the actions that are invoked because of a config change cannot be known apriori, but being able to at least associate a failure with a request and show that "something" failed is important.

== Futures ==
# How with distributed/partitioned data be handled?
# How will distributed/partitioned processing be handled?
# Should clients be able to put constraints around RPC invocations to indicate if a given request should ever go remote or should it only be invoked if locale?
# If we want to more ODL more towards an Erlang style processing model, how does that change the MD-SAL interfaces and the component implementations? Or is the plan to have an adaption layer between them?
