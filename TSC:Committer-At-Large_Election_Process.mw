== What ==
Two members of the OpenDaylight Committer community are elected each year to serve on the TSC.  The role of these At-Large Committer members is to represent the over-all committer community on the TSC.

== Who ==
This election and nomination process is limited to those individuals who have committer rights on one or more OpenDaylight Projects.  Any OpenDaylight Committer can nominate themselves, run for election, and vote in the election for the Committer-At-Large seats on the TSC.

== How ==
The election process occurs in two phases; the Nomination phase, and the Election phase.

=== Nomination Phase ===
# An email is sent from the Election Coordinator (Phil Robb) to the Committers distribution list for OpenDaylight and the subject line is tagged with the keywords [COMMITTER TSC NOMINATION].  The “TSC”, and “Discuss” mailing lists are also both cc-ed on this email.  
# Any committer may nominate themselves to stand for election.  Note that committers cannot nominate another committer to run for election.  If a committer wants another committer to run, they should express their support to that individual and suggest that the other committer run for election.
# To submit a nomination, the committer must reply-all to the original nomination email, or send a separate email with their self-nomination to the committer email list.
# All nominees are invited to publish their Picture, Biography, and Statement of Intent on the election wiki page so that the committer community can learn more about the candidate and their intentions for the role of Committer-At-Large on the TSC.  The nominee ordering on the election wiki page will be in ascending alphabetical order by last name.
# The length of the Nomination phase is 14 days.  This clock starts when the email described above is sent.

=== Election Phase ===
# Immediately upon the close of the Nomination Phase, an email will be sent from the Election Coordinator (Phil Robb) via the Condorcet Internet Voting Service (CIVS) to each committer within OpenDaylight.  This email will have the subject line: “Poll: OpenDaylight Committer-At-Large Election”.  This email acts as an invitation by the CIVS for each committer to vote.  This voting invitation is only sent to the Committers.  The TSC and Discuss mailing lists are not cc-ed on this email as per the CIVS process.  Included in this election invitation will be a pointer to the Election wiki page which contains the names, pictures, biographies, and statements-of-intent for each of the candidates. The email also has instructions and a private URL where each committer is sent to vote.
# At the CIVS-provided voting URL, each voter will rank the candidates, where a smaller-numbered rank means that the voter prefers that choice more.  Once the ranking is complete, the voter will press the “Submit ranking” button to complete the voting process.
# The Election Phase will remain open for 14 days from the time the invitation-to-vote email is sent by the CIVS.
# Once the Election Phase has completed, the results of the election will be reviewed by the Election Coordinator, the OpenDaylight Executive Director, and the TSC Chair.  The top two, best-ranked individuals that come from separate, unaffiliated companies will be designated as the winners of the election.
# Immediately after the Election Review, an email will be sent by the Election Coordinator to the Committer mailing list indicating the winners of the election.  The “TSC” and “Discuss” mailing lists will be cc-ed on this mail.
