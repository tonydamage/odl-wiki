== Externally Consumable APIs

* To be defined by M3

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|API |API Status |Short description
|Device type Info Model |Available |Defines an MD-SAL data store model
that will contain information used to determine the type of device.

|Device Type Augmentation |Available |Defines an MD-SAL data store
augmentation that contain the type of device.

|Device State Augmentation |Available |Defines an MD-SAL data store
augmentation that contain the device's state.

|AdjustFlow |Available |Defines an RPC that can be used to validate and
adjust Flow Mods. This defines the API only. Driver can be developed
that implement this API for specific device types.

[[requests-from-other-projects]]
== Requests from Other Projects

For each API / feature request, the requesting project MUST:

* open Enhancement bug in Bugzilla describing request with Issue Type:
Improvement, Change Request or New Feature
* create an entry as described in
Simultaneous_Release:Per-Project_Lithium_Release_Plan_Template#Example_Request[Release
Plan - Request template], which will also contain number / link to the
bug. After creating the entry, the requesting project MUST:

:* send an e-mail to release@lists.opendaylight.org (mandated by
Simultaneous Release)

:* and both projects' dev lists using this template (mandated by
Simultaneous Release)
