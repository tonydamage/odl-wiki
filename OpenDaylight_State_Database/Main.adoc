[[overview]]
= Overview

The OpenDaylight State Database (OSD) is a proposed architectural
component of the controller platform that serves as a hub to
access/share/persist state from the other components in the system.

OSD presents a tree model to clients. Different parts of the tree are
backed by different storage backends depending on the storage
characteristics/requirements described in the data schema. The overall
logical data tree is the union of all of the overlaid physical trees
from the different storage backends.

OSD can be deployed either as a standalone component or embedded in
another program (e.g. OpenDaylight Controller). In the standalone mode
clients maintain persistent connections with OSD through which they can
invoke request/reponse-style read/write operations and receive
notifications. In the embedded mode the embedding application can invoke
operations directly on the interface/class that implements the OSD API.

The REST API is implemented as a separate client of the core OSD
component and serves as the interface for external applications to
access OSD. It mostly proxies requests through to the underlying OSD,
except that it implements a permissions system to enforce AAA.

The goals of the OpenDaylight State Database are:

* Provide a unified way to access data from all of the components in the
system.
* Support access from multiple languages with minimal effort to support
additional languages
* Support a more flexible tree model for the data instead of flat tables
* Provide a standard way to define the schema of the data with support
for extensibility of data types
* Support a notification mechanism that works across controller nodes in
a cluster
* Support AAA

[[schema-definition]]
= Schema Definition

The logical tree is specified by schema definitions. The schema
definitions are loaded at startup (but we could eventually support
dynamic schema definition)

The data schema supports the following types:

* *Boolean:* true or false
* *Integer:* a long integer (or possibly multi-precision, but that may
not be supported by all client languages)
* *Floating Point:* a double
* *String:* a UTF8 character string
* *Date/Time:* a UTC date/time, probably encoded as something like
microseconds since the epoch
* *Binary Data:* a blob of binary data
* *List*: of either one of the scalar data types or a aggregate data
type
* *Aggregate:* typically specified by defining a custom aggregate data
type and specifying a node of the tree to be that data type (or a list
of the data type).
* *Reference:* a link to another part of the tree (sort of like a
symbolic link in the Unix file system)

Common attributes of nodes in the schema are:

* *Access Mode:* Read-only, Write-only or Read/Write
* *Data Source Mapping:* For example, "Config" attribute to distinguish
between config vs. operational state data sources
* *Default Value*
* *Restrictions:* For example, Range restrictions for integer values,
Length/RegEx restrictions for string values
* *Units:* For example, seconds/milliseconds/microseconds for a setting
that specifies a period/duration

There are several options for how the data schema is specified. Options
that have been discussed are:

* YANG
* custom JSON/YAML format
* Java class (stylized subset of java; data members map to subnodes in
the tree)

YANG seems to be the closest thing to a standard for defining this sort
of thing, so we will likely use that (and other parts of this document
assume that).

[[osd-api]]
= OSD API

OSD provides the following abstract operations:

* *Read Schema:* Return the data schema for a node of the tree. Input is
the path to the node of the tree to read.
* *Write Schema:* Update the data schema for a data type or a node of
the tree. Input is the data schema (in some representation TBD).
Initially we don't support this option and instead only support
definition of schema via static schema configuration files (i.e YANG
files)
* *Read Data:* Read data from the tree. Input is the path to the node of
the tree to read and a "Recursive" flag for whether to return the
complete subtree rooted at the specified path. Output is the data for
the specified node.
* *Query Tree:* Query for data in a subtree. Input is the root path of a
node in the tree to search and a query specification. Still need to
decide the format of the query, but probably something based on a really
simple subset of CSS selectors or XMLQuery. Output is the data that
matches the query.
* *Write:* Write a new node of the tree. Input is the path to the node
of the tree to write and the (possibly hierarchical) data to write. The
data must conform with the data schema for that node of the tree.
* *Delete:* Delete a node of the tree. Input is the path to the node of
the tree to delete.
* *Register Notification:* Register to receive notifications about
modifications to the tree. Input is the path to node of the tree
* *Unregister Notification:* Unregister a notification that was
previously registered. Input is the path to the node of the tree. [Or if
we want to allow multiple notification for a single client on the same
path we can return a notification token when the notification is
register that is used to unregister it.]
* *Register Dynamic Node:* Register a client callback to back a node of
the tree with data that's generated dynamically by the client.
Read/write operations to that data node invoke a callback to the client
instead of being backed by one of built-in storage backends.
* *Unregister Dynamic Node:* Unregister a dynamic data node that was
previously registered by the client. Input is the path to the node of
the tree.
* *Begin Transaction:* Begin a transaction on a node of the tree.
Subsequent write operations are only visible to the client that
initiated the transaction.
* *Commit Transaction:* Commit a transaction. Data modified during the
the transaction is now visible to other clients (including invocation of
any notifications that were registered).
* *Rollback Transaction:* Rollback a transaction. All data modifications
made since the transaction was begun are discarded.
