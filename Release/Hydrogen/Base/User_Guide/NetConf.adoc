The Network Configuration Protocol, NETCONF, is an IETF network
management protocol. It was developed in the NETCONF working group and
published in December 2006 as RFC 4741 and later revised in June 2011
and published as RFC 6241. The NETCONF protocol specification is an
Internet Standards Track document.

NETCONF provides mechanisms to install, manipulate, and delete the
configuration of network devices. Its operations are realized on top of
a simple Remote Procedure Call (RPC) layer. The NETCONF protocol uses an
Extensible Markup Language (XML) based data encoding for the
configuration data as well as the protocol messages. This in turn is
realized on top of the transport protocol. (from Wikipedia)
