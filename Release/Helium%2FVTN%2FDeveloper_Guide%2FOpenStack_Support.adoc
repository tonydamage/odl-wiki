= Overview

VTN Manager implementation has neutron module, which provides the
network service for OpenStack. VTN manager utilizes the OVSDB plugin
service. OpenStack updates node information in OVSDB as an Event which
is utilized in VTN Manager for network service.

::
  The following are the key features of this implementation:

* The VTN Manager's Neutron handles interface creation events from OVSBD
plugin and creates mapping between OF ports and virtual interfaces in
VTN.
* It also Enables VTN Manager to associate VMs with virtual networks,
and install flow entries to OF switches between VMs which ensures
connectivity.

The following diagram illustrates the current implementation VTN Manager
and OVSDB plugin integration.

= Configuration

Please refer link:Release/Helium/VTN/User Guide/OpenStack Support[Open
Stack Support (User Guide)] for the use and configuration.

[[openstack-configuration-details]]
== OpenStack Configuration Details

Follow the below steps to configure devstack with ODL controller:

[[control-node]]
=== Control Node

\a) Disable nova network(n-net) and enable neutron. +
b) Enable service odl-compute (Optionally you can enable odl-server
also, which will download and deploy ODL in the particular node). +
c) Set ODL_MGR_IP with IP Address of ODL. +
d) Make all network types as local, as there is no support for vlan in
Helium. +
e) Add the ODL neutron URL for devstack to post requests. +

[[compute-node]]
=== Compute Node

\a) To configure Compute node follows the steps b,c and d of Control
Node. +
b) Very few services are enabled like neutron,n-cpu and rabbit. +
c) Set the IP Address of the Control Node. +
c) The neutron URL is not needed to be set in compute node. +
d) The Controller node services are added as the service hosts for
various services.

[[odl-configuration-details]]
== ODL Configuration Details

The implementation makes use of a configuration file *vtn.ini* in the
OpenDaylight configuration directory. The name of the bridge in
Openstack OVS, the physical interface device name to be used for VM's
are mentioned in this file. The vtn.ini is created with the below
parameters and the explanation for them is as follows

`bridgename=br-int` +
`portname=eth1` +
`protocols=OpenFlow13` +
`failmode=secure`

The values of the configuration parameters must be changed based on the
user environment. Especially, portname should be carefully
configured.Because if the value is wrong, OpenDaylight controller fails
to forward packets. Other parameters works fine as is for general use
cases.

* *bridgename*
** The name of the bridge in Open-v-Switch, that will be created by
OpenDaylight Controller.
** It must be "br-int".
* *portname*
** The name of the port that will be created in the vbridge in Open
vSwitch.
** This must be the same name of the interface of OpenStack Nodes which
is used for interconnecting OpenStack Nodes in data plane.(in our
case:eth1)
** By default, if vtn.ini is not created, VTN uses ens33 as portname.
* *protocols*
** OpenFlow protocol through which OpenFlow Switch and Controller
communicate.
** The values can be OpenFlow13 or OpenFlow10.
* *failmode*
** The value can be "standalone" or "secure".
** Please use "secure" for general use cases.

If the file is not found, the following default values are assumed

`bridgename=br-int` +
`portname=eth1` +
`protocols=OpenFlow13` +
`failmode=secure`

[[vtn-manager]]
=== VTN Manager:

When starting up, VTN Manager subscribes to the events from OVSDB and
also implements the neutron API.

* Devstack:
** StartUp:

::
  ;;
    1.The ML2 implementation for ODL Controller will ensure that when
    Open-v-switch is started to create networking for neutron, the
    ODL_IP_ADDRESS configured will be set as manager.

::
  ;;
    2. When ODL Controller receives the update of the OVS from OVSDB
    plugin in the port:6640, (Manager port) VTN Manager handles the
    event and adds a bridge with required port mappings to the
    Open-V-Switch at openstack node as per the paramters in vtn.ini.

::
  ;;
    3.When neutron starts up, a new Network create is POSTED to ODL, for
    which VTN Manager creates a VTN.

* Network and Sub-Network Create:

::
  Whenever a new sub network is created, VTN Manager will handle the
  same and create a vbridge under the VTN.

* VM Creation in openstack:

::
  The interface mentioned as integration bridge in the configuration
  file, will be added with more interfaces on creation of a new VM in
  Openstack and network is provisioned for it by VTN neutron bundle.
  +
  The addition of new PORT is captured by VTN Manager and it creates a
  vbridge interface with port mapping for the particular port.

When the VM starts to communicate with other VMâ€™s created, VTN Manger
will install flows in the OVS and other openflow switches to facilitate
communication between VM's. +
