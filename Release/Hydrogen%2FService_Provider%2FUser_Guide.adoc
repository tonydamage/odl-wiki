== Overview and Architecture

The Service Provider edition of OpenDaylight is designed for network
operator use. It does not include OVSDB, VTN or DOVE, but does include
SNMP, BGP-LS, PCEP, and LISP southbound and the Affinity Service and the
LISP Service northbound. The following diagram shows OpenDaylight
Service Provider edition architecture in details:

== Installation Guide

The installation instructions for Service Provider Edition can be found
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Release/Hydrogen/Service_Provider/Installation_Guide[here].

[[configuration]]
== Configuration

To configure OpenDaylight Service Provider edition using the OpenFlow
1.3 plugin, start Opendaylight Controller with the _-of13_ option. If
you do not use the option, the controller will use the OpenFlow 1.0
version.

* To start mininet for the OpenFlow 1.3 simulation, use the following
command: _mininet> sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=a.b.c.d --topo tree,2
--switch ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow13_

* To start mininet for the OpenFlow 1.0 simulation, use the following
command: _mininet> sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=10.125.136.52 --topo
tree,2_

[[overview-and-architecture-1]]
=== Overview and Architecture

Current SDN technology is usually assumed to be based on network
infrastructures using OpenFlow switches. Actually, SDN is not limited to
OpenFlow, for example OpenDaylight SAL can support multiple southbound
protocols. To fulfill the scope of underlying switches supported in
OpenDaylight, Ethernet switches should also be considered.

Commodity Ethernet switches have the advantage of low price and is
programmable to some extent (i.e. using CLI and SNMP to modify the ACL,
MAC table, forwarding table, etc). In an SDN built on commodity Ethernet
switches, the upper layer applications could be responsible for making
all the forwarding decisions for each switch, and the switches execute
data plane forwarding as assigned. Therefore, we believe that commodity
Ethernet switch has its advantage and warrants a position in SDN
technology development.

Off-the-shelf commodity Ethernet switches are commonly allowed to be
configured by SNMP, and the Ethernet switch can actively report its
status to the administrative computer (i.e. OpenDaylight controller)
using SNMP trap. Therefore, we propose an SNMP southbound plugin to
control underlying devices supporting SNMP using off-the-shelf commodity
Ethernet switch. In addition to SNMP support, this plugin will provide
capabilities to manage configurations that can only be accessed via CLI,
e.g. ACL, disabling flooding, etc., since such configurations are
necessary for using Ethernet switches for SDN. Therefore, there will be
three phases in this project, as follows. (1) Creating an SNMP
SouthBound Plugin: to configure Ethernet switches via SNMP. (2) The
plugin configures Ethernet switches via CLI, for settings that SNMP
cannot access. (3) SAL extension: for (1) and (2) we will contribute
extensions to the SAL configuration APIs to provide additional API to
support SNMP and CLI usage as specified above.

[[overview-and-architecture-2]]
=== Overview and Architecture

Locator ID Separation Protocol
(http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc6830[LISP]) is a technology that
provides a flexible map-and-encap framework that can be used for overlay
network applications, such as data center network virtualization, and
Network Function Virtualization (NFV). LISP introduces two name spaces:
Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs), and Routing Locators (RLOCs). In a
virtualization environment, EIDs can be viewed as virtual address space
and RLOCs can be viewed as physical network address space.

The LISP framework decouples network control plane from the forwarding
plane by providing: (1) a data plane that specifies how the virtualized
network addresses are encapsulated in addresses from the underlying
physical network, and (2) a control plane that stores the mapping of the
virtual-to-physical address spaces and the associated forwarding
policies, and serves this information to the data plane on demand.
Network programmability is achieved by programming forwarding policies
such as transparent mobility, service chaining, and traffic engineering
in the mapping system, where the data plane elements can fetch these
policies on demand as new flows arrive. In this presentation we explain
how the LISP Flow Mapping project in ODL can be used to enable advanced
SDN and NFV use cases.

The Lisp Flow Mapping service provides
http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc6830[LISP] Mapping System services. This
includes LISP Map-Server and LISP Map-Resolver services, to store and
serve the _mapping data_ to data plane nodes as well as to OpenDaylight
applications. Mapping data can include mapping of virtual addresses to
physical network address where the virtual nodes are reachable/hosted
at. Mapping data can also include a variety of routing policies
including traffic engineering and load balancing. To leverage this
service, a northbound API allows OpenDaylight applications and services
to define the mappings and policies in the LISP Mapping Service. This
project also includes a southbound LISP plugin that enables LISP
dataplane devices to interact with the OpenDaylight via the LISP
protocol.
