The simplest and easiest way to install OpenDaylight is to download the
pre-built zip file which you can find above.

*Prerequisites:*

* _Are there others? Python?_

*Understanding The Structure:*

* The main content of OpenDaylight Hydrogen is in a directory called
_opendaylight_, where you will see the following files:
** _run.sh_ — launches OpenDaylight on Linux/Mac/Unix systems
** _run.bat_ — launches OpenDaylight on Windows systems
** _version.properties_ — indicates the build version
** _configuration_ — basic initialization files (internal to
OpenDaylight)
** _lib_ — Java libraries
** _plugins_ — OpenDaylight's OSGi plugins

*Running OpenDaylight:*

1.  Enter _./run.sh_ or _./run.bat_ with administrator privileges to
launch OpenDaylight.
2.  Navigate to
_http://<ip-address-of-machine-where-you-ran-opendaylight>:8080_ to open
the web interface, then use the following credentials to log in:
* User: admin
* Password: admin
3.  If you are running OpenDaylight on the same machine as your browser,
you can browse to _http://localhost:8080_ or _http://127.0.0.1:8080_ to
avoid needing to know the IP address of the machine you are using.
