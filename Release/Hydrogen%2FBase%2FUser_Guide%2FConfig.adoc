== Installation

The installation instructions for the Base Edition can be found
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Release/Hydrogen/Base/Installation_Guide[here].

A list of troubleshooting steps for installation can be found

under the *Troubleshooting* section.

[[configuration]]
== Configuration

To configure OpenDaylight Base edition using the OpenFlow 1.3 plugin,
start Opendaylight Controller with the _-of13_ option. If you do not use
the option, the controller will use the OpenFlow 1.0 version.

* To start mininet for the OpenFlow 1.3 simulation, use the following
command: _$ sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=a.b.c.d --topo tree,2
--switch ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow13_

* To start mininet for the OpenFlow 1.0 simulation, use the following
command: _$ sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=10.125.136.52 --topo tree,2_

=== Setup Using the Graphical Interface

Log in using your credentials. The default credentials are
user=admin/password=admin. The first page appears.

 +
Under the Devices tab, all of the created nodes are listed with their
Node ID and Ports. For example, if you set up Mininet to emulate a
network topology by running _sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=a.b.c.d
--topo tree,2_, you create a network of tree structure with 3 switches.
Those switches will be shown under the Devices menu as well as on the
graphical interface, as shown below:

 +

 +
You can add a gateway by clicking on the button "Add Gateway IP Address"
on the buttom-middle of the page: +

 +
You can also add flow entries by clicking on the button "Add Flow Entry"
on the top-left of the page: +
image:flow.png[flow.png,title="fig:flow.png"]

 +
The minimum requirements to install a flow in a node are to identify the
node (switch) and action for the flow entry. You can find other
parameters for the flow at
http://openvswitch.org/cgi-bin/ovsman.cgi?page=utilities%2Fovs-ofctl.8[here]
under the Flow Syntax.

 +
You can access the Admin menu from top-right of the page by clicking on
the *admin* selection. The available options are:

* *Users* to manage the users and their role
* *Cluster* for the cluster manager for high availability
* *OSGi* to access the OSGi management console
* *Save* to save the current setup
* *Logout* to exit from the GUI

=== Programmatic Interfaces

For programmatic interfaces, the starting point for developers is
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/GettingStarted:Developer_Main[here].
This page provides information about pulling, hacking, and pushing the
code from CLI. The OpenDaylight Controller allows developers to observe
and manage the controller via web applications. A programmer guide can
be found
