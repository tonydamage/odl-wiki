=Overview=

OpenStack is an open source Cloud Management System that provides an environment similar to Amazon EC2. It integrates with various networking solutions using a service called Quantum. Quantum defines a plug-in model for various 3rd party components to provide the networking service. The OpenDaylight SDN Controller Platform provides a plugin and a corresponding agent to enable integration with Quantum. This section explains how to install/enable that service.

Integrating ONV with a complete OpenStack deployment is beyond the scope of this section and guide. 

=Installation and Configuration=

==Enabling Quantum==

To use this plugin on the OpenDaylight SDN Controller Platform you need to:

* Install the agent for restproxy plugin support
* And enable the quantum feature from the CLI

Install the agent on OSCP as:

 bsc> debug bash
 bsc$ networkservice-install

Enable quantum feature from CLI as:

 bsc> enable
 bsc# configure
 bsc(config)#  feature networkservice

Ensure the web port is accessible from the OpenStack/Quantum controller as (do this for each controller):

 bsc> enable
 bsc# configure
 bsc(config)# controller-node <nodeA>
 bsc(config-controller)# interface Ethernet 0
 bsc(config-controller-if)# firewall allow web
 bsc(config)# controller-node <nodeB>
 bsc(config-controller)# interface Ethernet 0
 bsc(config-controller-if)# firewall allow web

View the Controller ID's as:

 show controller-node all

Usage Guide

Once configured, creating virtual networks, virtual machines, and corresponding interfaces is managed through Openstack and you do not need to use the CLI for those operations.

Virtual networks in OpenStack now correspond to VNSs. You can use normal Big Network Controller to provide richer networking services, access control and visibility.
