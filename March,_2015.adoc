Attendees: Sharon, Basheer, Mohnish, Vasanthan, YuLing

* We went through the M4 task list and please refer to the attached list
for the finalized tasks and owners for M4.
* YuLing will send out an email to OpenFlow plugin team to ask the
following questions:
** What is the behavior of notification generation for OF stats. If the
metrics do not change the value, is there any notification being
generated?
** How to generate different types of OF traffic using mininet?
** Does OF plugin support OF 1.0 statistics collection?
* Our goal is to check in everything for M4 by April 9th so that
Vasanthan can start his integration test based on the code merged into
main.
* Basheer to send out existing Karaf commands for installing tsdr
features and retrieve data from TSDR data stores.
* For the commands that we’re developing, we will send out the commands
as soon as we finalize the commands format.
* Basheer showed the demo of TSDR default H2 data store and HBase data
store, as well as switching between these two data stores.
* YuLing will poll the team to find out a time slot for TSDR weekly
meeting that fits everyone’s schedule.
