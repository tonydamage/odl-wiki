* The MODB should reach initial features by the end of the week, which doesn't mean it's complete. There are still a considerable number of features that are intended before initial release, versioning, etc..
* The Policy Enforcer (PE), is evolving to a point that the initial process flows are being discussed and developments are being made. Initial pass will be to implement monitoring using OF and OVSDB interactions.
* The Policy Management (PM) layer is still in flux.

* The MODB has reached a place where we are going to park it for a bit, and I am proceeding to work on the PM layer & OpFlex protocol session handlers.
* The Policy Enforcer (PE): got a prototype ovsdb-based monitor working and realized that opflex needs to link directly to OVS libraries; working on that now.
* The Policy Management (PM) layer is being designed and developed.
* We will update the design document when time permits.
