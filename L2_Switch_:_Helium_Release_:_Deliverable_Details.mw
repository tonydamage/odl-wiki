== Packet Handler ==
1. packet decoding infrastructure that has base class for all decoders.<br />
2. yang models and decoders for Ethernet, ARP, IPV4, IPV6.<br />

== Address Tracker ==
1. Yang model that augments inventory node connector to store address observations.  <br />
2. currently it would store  mac, Ip and vlan observed on each node connector.<br />

== Network Loop Elimination  ==
1. Augment node connector to have a spanning tree state (Discarding, Forwarding)<br />
2. listen to topology changes and compute the MST based on current topology. Each link addition or elimination would result is reconstruction of MST. For MST it assumes the cost of each link is same at this time.<br />
3. update the node connector augmentation with appropriate state. (Discarding, Forwarding) , based links that are not present in MST <br />

== L2 Switch Main ==
1. Track address: a module that leverages address tracker model to store the observations in inventory tree by listening to ARP, IPV4, and IPV6 packets.<br />
2. Transmit packet back: it would transmit the packet back to switch using node connectors that are in 'Forwarding' state.<br />
3. write flows: Writes flow to the switch if both src and dest mac is known in "ARP, IPV4, and IPV6" packets that it consumed in point 1.<br />
4. Delete flows: Listen to augmented node connector data changes for state change, and delete flows forwarding to a node that is marked as "Discarding" <br />
