Attendees: Basheer, Sharon, YuLing

* YuLing showed a demo using TSDR POC code to collect data from OpenFlow
statistics and store into HBase. At the same time, a simple GUI chart
shows the Active Flow counts by polling the collected data from HBase.
* Sharon suggested looking into
grafana(https://github.com/jbooth/graphite-data, http://grafana.org/),
which is a GUI tool for professional charts that works with time series
data.
* We definitely should look into this tool to see how itâ€™s going to help
with ODL after the time series data is captured into the persistence
data store.
* YuLing mentioned that from POC/demo experience, there seem to be some
issues with constantly getting data from openflow plugin/statistics
manager. Sharon is going to follow up on this issue with OpenFlow plugin
team.
* Basheer went through his proposal for TSDR Karaf features.
* YuLing is going to send Ed Warnicke an email to ask about the detailed
rationale of starting hbase server from Karaf and packaging hbase server
installation files together with ODL tar ball.
* YuLing is going to send Basheer the hbase bundle info for creating
hbase karaf features.
* Basheer mentioned that according to discussions with Sharon,
notification type of data collection might not be the best fit for
openflow stats. Some design details will be added to Data Collection
design doc for further/future design/development of other types of data
collectors to provide more efficient data collection mechanism for TSDR.
However, for Lithium, we will focus on the Notification Data Collector
as the deliverables.

Summary of To do tasks:

* Sharon to follow up on OpenFlow plugin data collection issues.
* YuLing to send email to Edward Warnicke for Karaf features.
* Basheer to send out data model code example that contains good
documentation and comments.
* Basheer to update Data Collection Design doc to capture further
discussions with Sharon on different types of data collectors.
