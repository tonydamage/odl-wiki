odl-groupbasedpolicy-ofoverlay

[[description-1]]
== Description

Overview

* The OpenFlow Overlay renderer is used to create a network
virtualization overlay using OpenFlow flows.

Design Architecture

*
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Group_Policy:Architecture/OpenFlow_Renderer[OpenFlow
Renderer]
*
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Group_Policy:Architecture/OVS_Overlay[OpenFlow
Overlay Architecture]

Configuration

* The OpenFlow overlay renderer requires the following configuration:
** Global Configuration
*** encapsulation-format: The encapsulation format to use for tunnels
**** vxlan: Use VXLAN encapsulation
*** learning-mode: Selects how and whether we learn endpoints
**** orchestrated: An external orchestration system will provide
information about all endpoints, and no direct learning will occur.
** Endpoint Configuration
*** location-type: internal or external
**** internal: The endpoint is located on a port that is part of the
overlay network. You must include the node ID and port number for this
endpoint.
**** external: This endpoint is not inside the overlay.
*** node-id: The OpenFlow switch for the endpoint. Must be included for
all internal endpoints. The format is openflow:[dpid] where the dpid is
the value of the switch DPID cast to a long.
*** node-connector-id: The node connector for the endpoint's OpenFlow
port. The format is openflow:[dpid]:[port] where the dpid is the value
of the switch DPID cast to a long, and port is the openflow port number
of the interface where the endpoint is connected.
** Inventory Configuration
*** tunnel-ip: The IP address used for tunnel termination on this switch
*** ovsdb-config:ip: The IP address used to connect to OVSDB on this
switch
*** ovsdb-config:port The port number used to connect to OVSDB on this
switch (default 6640)
*** external-interfaces The names of the OpenFlow interfaces that are
external and lead to the underlay network. Can be specified as a regular
expression.

No dependencies.

[[incompatibilities-1]]
== Incompatibilities

This renderer is potentially incompatible with any other application
that writes to flow tables. This includes:

* OVSDB Network Virtualization
* VTN
* OpenDOVE
* Service Function Chaining OpenFlow Renderer

Since each of these provides similar functionality, they are not
anticipated to operate simultaneously with the OpenFlow Overlay
Renderer.

[[network-intrusiveness-1]]
== Network Intrusiveness

The OpenFlow Overlay renderer doesn't program flows without registration
of endpoints, and therefore is non-intrusive to the network.
