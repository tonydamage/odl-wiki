Some draft scaling numbers for policy: Note: these have been split int
DC and NFV cases (the NFV case needs more work, but as it is a larger
scale, it will be addressed at a later date):

[[data-center-to-be-honed-further]]
== Data Center (to be honed further)

* 25K end point groups
* 1K qualities
* 1K requirements
* 1K capabilities
* 1K condition
* 1K subject feature definitions
* 1K tenants
* 64 contracts per group
* 200K end points in aggregate
* 5K resolvers (DC case) [the intent is not to store these in the GBP
data store, direct, but rather this is a view of how the ODL inventory
storage should scale]

[[nfv-needs-a-lot-of-work]]
== NFV (needs a lot of work)

Note: this is *not* intended to be target for Helium

* ??? subject feature definitions
* 100K tenants
* 1024K end point groups
* 250K resolvers (NFV case)
* 10M end points in aggregate

Some NFV rate numbers to consider (and yes, the numbers are meant to
imply sub second/sub two second recovery times):

* adding members to groups: 300K/sec
* adding resolvers: 200K/sec
* contract resolution: 70K/sec per resolver

[[unified-communications-enterprise-scale]]
== Unified Communications (Enterprise Scale)

* 100K Endpoints
* 10K sessions active at any given time (peak)
* Session = conversation(voice, video, app sharing)
* Session = 2 - 6 flows
* 5K Call Setups/minute ( ~ 80/sec)
* Average x3 for # flows/second = ~240 flows per second
* Policy change and rendering rates peak in hundreds per second.
