[[introduction]]
== Introduction

The Group Based Policy project proposes the following additions to the
Lithium release:

* Added a Neutron API Provider
* Added the Exception repository.
* Added the Operation State repository.
* More modularized features. There currently are only two features
defined for The groupbasedpolicy project:
odl-groupbasedpolicy-ofoverlay, and
odl-integration-compatible-with-groupbasedpolicy. These two features
will be deprecated in favor of a more modular set of features.
* Support for feature-loadable renderers. This will allow the desired
renderer to be loaded and used. Note that the Lithium release only
supports a single renderer at a time.
* Support for OpFlex renderer.
* Support or Plugin to OpenContrail renderer.
* Integration with OpenStack Group Based Policy.
* New version of the policy YANG model (fixes errors in the YANG model).

In addition, the policy model from the Helium release will be deprecated
in support of the new one (see above), and the features supported in
Helium will also be deprecated in support of a more modular set

[[externally-consumable-apis]]
== Externally Consumable APIs

Please list and describe all externally consumable APIs or point to a
document that does so. This need not be a list of all java interfaces
and yang files, but should be a list of high-level functionality, e.g.,
flow programming.

* Unchanged from Helium:
** register/unregister endpoint, setting conditions,
** policy, tenant
* New Lithium:
** register L3Prefix Endpoint
** added fields to existing policy API (backwards compatible).
** Neutron SB Impl for Neutron NB API project.

*PLEASE NOTE: items in italics are tenative*

* base
** policy (CONF/OPER data)
** endpoint (OPER data)
** events/exception/health repository (CONF/OPER data)
* renderers
** ofoverlay renderer (CONF/OPER data)
** opflex renderer (CONF/OPER data)
** opencontrail renderer (CONF/OPER data)
* providers
** neutron API implementation (CONF/OPER data)

[[expected-incompatibilities-with-other-projects]]
== Expected Incompatibilities with Other Projects

This OpenFlow Overlay renderer is considered incompatible with
applications that program the flow tables on vSwitches. This includes:

* VTN
* OVSDB
* OpenDOVE

The OpenFlow Overlay renderer attempts to install flows in the flow
tables of vSwitches when policy is resolved in order to create a Network
Virtualization solution. The applications listed above also provide this
functionality, and therefore are incompatible.

These projects have not held discussions as to how to become compatible
because they each provide their own solution to the same problem.

== Compatibility with Previous Releases

[[removed-apis-andor-functionality]]

[[themes-and-priorities]]
== Themes and Priorities

[[requests-from-other-projects]]
== Requests from Other Projects

For each API request, the requesting project should create an entry like
the example below. After creating the entry, the requesting project
should send an e-mail to release@lists.opendaylight.org, and both
projects' dev lists using this template:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [REQUEST FOR NEW OR EXTENDED API] ${API name}

Note: This email is a request from ${requesting project} for a new or
extended API in ${providing project}.

API Name: ${API name}
Request: ${link to the request in the providing project's release plan}

Please let us know if you will be able to provide this new
functionality by the listed milestone. If you need clarifications or
help in providing the API, let us know so we can reach an agreement.

If you feel that providing this API is a bad idea regardless of where
the resources are coming from, please let us know why and ideally,
suggest and alternative.
