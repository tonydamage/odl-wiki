 State repositories support both simple queries on the data but more
important allow subscriptions to the data, so that systems that are
responsible for applying the policy model are informed about changes to
that policy configuration or operational state that might affect the
policy. Those subsystems are expected to continuously reevaluate the
policy as these changes come in make the required changes in the
underlying infrastructure.
