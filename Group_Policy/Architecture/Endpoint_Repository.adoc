 The endpoint repository is responsible for storing metadata about
endpoints, including how they are mapped into endpoint groups.
Information about endpoints can be added to the repository either by a
central orchestration system or by a renderer that performs discovery to
learn about new endpoints. In either case, the semantics of how an
endpoint is mapped to an endpoint group are not defined here; the system
that sets up the information in the endpoint repository must have its
own method for assigning endpoints to endpoint groups.
