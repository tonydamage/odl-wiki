*Features*

* Proof of Concept - ability to show ICMP and unidirectional HTTP
between OVS instances using Group Based Policy.

*Non-Code Aspects (user docs, examples, tutorials, articles)*

* Docs:
** WIP - Currently reviewing Gerrit
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/11377/.
** Meeting 09/24/14 with GBP docs owner for update. Will have ASCIIDOCs
ETA after that. Target 9/26/14
* Group_Policy:Building and Running[Building and Running/Tutorial]
* Group_Policy:Architecture[Architecture]

*Architectural Issues*

* UML model is complex
* REST API at this stage, further development suggested for GUI.
* Southbound renderers potentially involve multi-project collaboration.

*Security Issues*

* None of any note. Uses REST API.

*Quality Assurance (test coverage, etc)*

* JUNIT Classes: 597 Line coverage: 30% (5235/17301) Branch coverage:
16% (1459/8922) Complexity: 2.813
* Not integrated with SONAR.
** Once blocking bugs sorted, this and Docs are #1. Testing (see below)
a high priority moving forward.

*End-of-life (API/Features EOLed in Release - If any)*

* N/A

*Bugzilla (summary of bug situation)*

* Bug 2023: Group Mod message not being sent to switch in
groupbasedpolicy Proof of Concept demo: *RESOLVED*
* Bug 2019: GBP fails to launch intermittently when launched from Karaf:
Major: Helium-2/Lithium *BLOCKER*
* Bug 2051 - one node is short 12 flow mods when running the GBP POC
demo *BLOCKER*

*Standards (summary of standard compliance)*

* Nothing specific.

*Schedule (initial schedule and changes over the release cycle) - This
include an Scope-Reductions needed to hold schedule*

* Scope Reductions pushed to Lithium
** Indexing/Sharding/Ageing (M2)
** Operational State and Enforcement repositories (M2)
** OpFlex renderer (M5)
* Scope Reductions to Lithium or later
** OVSDB renderer (M5)

*Lessons Learned*

* TESTING! TESTING! TESTING! - need nightly Jenkins build tests, and
also dependency triggered Jenkins tests.
* Planning on shamelessly stealing from OVSDB's dave_tucker awesomeness.

*Stable Release participation*

* As per
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Helium_Service_Release_Expectations
... seems like a "good idea" (tm)
* Have questions about how documentation will be handled. ie small
self-contained bug fix goes into stable but prompts a change in API in
main (for hypothetical arguments sake). How are docs managed if someone
pulls the stable helium branch, all helium docs clearly apply, but then
is it on the project to keep docs on main up to date??? Or is it "use at
your own peril" ?
