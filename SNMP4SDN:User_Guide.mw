==Overview and Architecture==
We propose a southbound plugin that can control the off-the-shelf commodity Ethernet switches for the purpose of building SDN using Ethernet switches. For Ethernet switches, forwarding table and ACL are where one can install the flow configuration on, and this is done via SNMP and CLI in the proposed plugin. In addition, extensions to the SAL configuration APIs are needed to provide additional API to support some settings, e.g. disabling STP and flooding, etc, which are required for Ethernet switches in SDN.

===Architecture===
The modules in the plugin are depicted as the following figure, their features exposed to users includes flow configuration, topology discovery, proprietary configurations, statistic retrieving, and switch/port property retrieving. Brief guide is as follows, comprehensive guide could be found here(a link to developer guide’s).

Figure. Modules in the SNMP4SDN plugin

The exposed functions for users as well as the key design of the modules are shown in the table below. For the service modules, when they need to read or configure the underlying switches via SNMP or CLI, these queries are dealt with the modules SNMPHandler and CLIHandler which directly talk with the switches.

==Installation Troubleshooting==
None

==Configuration==
# Edit the switch list database file, a sample is here. Note that the first line is title and should not be removed.
# After Hydrogen is launched, in OSGi console, use the command ''s4sReadDB'' to read the switch list database file into SNMP4SDN plugin. 
<pre>
Command: s4sReadDB <filepath>
For example: s4sReadDB /home/sdnadmin/SwitchDB.txt
</pre>
# If one’d like to confirm whether the switch list database file is read correctly, use the command ''s4sPrintDB'' to show the database content
<pre>Command: s4sPrintDB</pre>
# Topology discovery: use the command ''s4sTopoDiscover'' so that the SNMP4SDN plugin will search and resolve the switches’ topology
<pre>Command: s4sTopoDiscover</pre>
