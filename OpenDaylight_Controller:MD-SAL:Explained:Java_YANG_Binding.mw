MD-SAL provides variation of APIs and Transfer Objects which are compile-time generated from YANG models
to allow easier development of applications, higher type-safety during compile time and lower barrier
for incomming development.

APIs and Transfer Objects are mostly model-ignorant - users of APIs are not required to programmatically
parse and understand YANG Schema.

Transfer objects are generated using [[YANG Tools:YANG to Java Mapping]] mapping.
