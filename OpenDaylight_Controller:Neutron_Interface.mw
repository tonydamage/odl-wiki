The Neutron interface is provided by the following two bundles:
*networkconfig.neutron
*networkconfig.neutron.northbound

== networkconfig.neutron bundle ==
=== contents ===
Two java packages:
*org.opendaylight.controller.networkconfig.neutron
*org.opendaylight.controller.networkconfig.neutron.internal

=== org.opendaylight.controller.networkconfig.neutron package ===
Contains
*JAXB annotated base Neutron object classes
*JAXB annotated subclasses implied from the Neutron API
*INeutron*CRUD interface definitions for the NB methods to use in manipulating Neutron objects
*INeutron*Aware interfaces for other bundles to use when registering services that are interested in Neutron objects (see below)

=== org.opendaylight.controller.networkconfig.neutron.internal package ===
Contains implementations of the INeutron*CRUD interfaces for storing Neutron objects in caches as well as the bundle Activator class.
== networkconfig.neutron.northbound bundle ==

=== contents ===
A single java package: org.opendaylight.controller.networkconfig.neutron.northbound containing
* JAX-RS annotated classes for supporting the API documented in [http://docs.openstack.org/api/openstack-network/2.0/content/index.html|OpenStack Networking API v2.0]
* JAX-B annotated specific Request classes for handling singleton and bulk requests per the API.

=== JAXB provider ===
The Neutron interface bundles use MOXy as the JAXB implementation/provider.  For more details on how, see [[ODMC: Using MOXy as the JAXB provider]]
