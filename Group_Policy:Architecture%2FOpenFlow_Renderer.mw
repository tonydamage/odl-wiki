The OpenFlow renderer is a network virtualization solution based on Open vSwitch, OpenFlow, and OVSDB.  It allows constructing virtual networks that use group-based policy among devices attached to Open vSwitch interfaces.  The features include:
* Routing when required between endpoint groups, including serving as a distributed default gateway
* Optional broadcast within a bridge domain.
* Management of L2 broadcast protocols including ARP and DHCP to avoid broadcasting.
* Layer 2-4 classifiers for policy between endpoint groups, including connection tracking/reflexive ACLs.
* Service insertion/redirection
