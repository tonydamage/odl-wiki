The OpenFlow renderer is based on the [[Group_Policy:Architecture/OVS Overlay|OVS Overlay]] design and implements a network virtualization solution for virtualized compute environments using Open vSwitch, OpenFlow and OVSDB remotely from the controller.

== Renderer Architecture ==
XXX - TODO
Main pieces:
* Switch Manager: Manage connected switch configuration using OVSDB.  Maintain overlay tunnels.
* ARP/DHCP manager: convert ARP and DHCP into unicast
* Endpoint manager: Optionally learn endpoints based on simple rules that map interfaces to endpoint groups.  Can add additional rules in the future.  Keep endpoint registry up to date.  If disabled, then an orchestration system must program all endpoints and endpoint mappings.
* Topology manager: Maintain topology and pathing information as needed.  Compute spanning trees for broadcast, etc.
* Routing manager: Maintain routing information
* Policy manager: subscribe to renderer common infrastructure and endpoint registry and manage the state of the flow tables in OVS.

== Configuration ==
XXX - TODO
* Mapping of interfaces to endpoint groups
* Mapping of endpoint groups to vnids/classes
