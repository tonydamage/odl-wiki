<onlyinclude>
The OpenFlow renderer is based on the [[Group_Policy:Architecture/OVS Overlay|OVS Overlay]] design and implements a network virtualization solution for virtualized compute environments using Open vSwitch, OpenFlow and OVSDB remotely from the controller.

== Renderer Architecture ==

=== Switch Manager === 
Manage connected switch configuration using OVSDB.  Maintain overlay tunnels.

=== Endpoint Manager ===
Optionally learn endpoints based on simple rules that map interfaces to endpoint groups.  Can add additional rules in the future.  Keep endpoint registry up to date.  If disabled, then an orchestration system must program all endpoints and endpoint mappings.

=== ARP and DHCP Manager ===
convert ARP and DHCP into unicast

=== Policy Manager ===
subscribe to renderer common infrastructure, and switch and endpoint manager.  Manage the state of the flow tables in OVS.

== Configuration ==
XXX - TODO
* Mapping of interfaces to endpoint groups
* Mapping of endpoint groups to vnids/classes
