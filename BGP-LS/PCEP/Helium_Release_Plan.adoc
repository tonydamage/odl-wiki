[[introduction]]
== Introduction

During the Helium code sprint we will focus on delivering two major
features:

* PCEP support for Segment Routing
* BGP support for route dissemination and passive connections

Secondary goals are keeping current with drafts as they evolve, bug
fixes and performance/scale improvements.

|Release Plan |Done |Final Release Plan

|API design of BGP speaker
|https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=729[Bug729] + |Speaker
capability requires us to rework AdjRIBsIn class into a per-peer
structure and MD-SAL writer. We will also need interfaces for export
engine.

|BGP Update message serializer + |Done |For the purpose of having a full
BGP speaker, having a serializer for all parts of Update message is a
must. This task also includes getting rid of using raw byte array in
other parts of BGP serialization, that will also improve clearness of
the code and performance.

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Status |Description
|Create model for AdjRibsIn/Out + |Done |Similar to the LocRib model, we
need a per-peer view of information which has been ingested (AdjRibIn)
and which is to be advertized (AdjRibOut)

|Support for Segment Routing |Done |For Helium, we are doing PCEP only.
This includes extending the models to support SR paths and the related
parsers/serializers.

|Support for BGP statistics
|https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=989[Bug989] |Simple
per-connection/per-rib statistics, which can be quickly reviewed. Number
of PDUs received/sent, time of last PDU send/received, negotiated
session capabilities.

|Implementation of BGP speaker.
|https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1116[Bug1116] |BGP stack
needs to be able to disseminate routes using a simple export policy.

|Update PCEP drafts
|https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=683[Bug683] |PCEP drafts
implemented in Hydrogen release are outdated and need to be adjusted to
newer draft versions.

|BGP speaker reconnect support
|https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=338[Done] |The speaker
role requires us to be able to establish both active and passive
sessions. The IO subsystem to handle that will be finished by API
freeze.

|Support PCEP statistics
|https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=989[Bug989] |Simple
per-session statistics, number of messages sent/received, time of last
message in/out, session characteristics, total number of PCErr messages

== Compatibility with Previous Releases

This release is expected to break both binary and source-code level
compatibility. All Java code plugins will need to be updated. Some
RESTCONF clients may need updating. The precise amount of breakage will
be established by API freeze.
