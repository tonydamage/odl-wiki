The OpenDaylight Controller provides you with a centralized logical view of their physical network topology, and enables&nbsp;you to coordinate forwarding rules changes with any of the network devices, on behalf of applications that directly manage network policies. 

OpenDaylight Controller uses the LLDP&nbsp;messages to discover the topology of the connected OpenFlow Devices. The '''Topology View''' tab provides a graphical view of the topology with switches and hosts. The OpenDaylight Controller's Topology Manager stores and manages information about the devices in the domain, including their capabilities and reachability. This information is stored and managed by the Topology Manager. Other components, including the ARP handler, Host Tracker, Device Manager, and Switch Manager help generate the topology database for the Topology Manager.
