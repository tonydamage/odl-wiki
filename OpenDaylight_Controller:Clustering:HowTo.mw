In order to setup an ODP controller cluster you need to have this pre-requisites:
# Have 2 or more hosting machines which can run host a controller.
# Make sure the machines either virtual of physical have IP connectivity among them and there are no firewalls that blocks ports 7800, 12001 <some others TBD>

Once the prerequisites are met to startup the cluster we need to:
# Elect one or more node to be a ''supernode''. The clustering architecture of ODP is built to mimic the P2P networks and given the cluster nodes don't know each others ahead of time, they need to have a way to meet an greet the others. Those nodes that perform the meet and greet functionality are called the ''supernodes''.
# Once the supernodes are chosen make sure to start those nodes first by running the controller with the command line:<br> '''./run.sh -Dsupernodes=<supernodesIP1>[:<supernodesIP2>][:<supernodesIP3>]..[:<supernodesIPN>]'''<br>
# Once the supernodes are started, starts the other nodes using the very same command line as above.
