Welcome to the ODL-SDNi project page!

==Introduction==

The OpenDaylight- SDN Interface Application project aims at enabling inter-SDN controller communication by developing SDNi (Software Defined Networking interface) as an application(ODL-SDNi App). The SDN application is deployable on OpenDaylight-Helium.Please see Project Proposal page as below:

* [[Project_Proposals:ODL-SDNi App|Project Proposal]]

== Getting Started with ODL-SDNi ==

We are still in development and have needs from developers to network guys or anywhere in between. All contributions from upstream code to docs and tutorials. Tutorials and getting started links will be added shortly.

== Weekly SDL-SDNi App Meeting (Open to All) ==

==High-Level Design==

For High Level Design and Architecture please refer the project proposal page for more deatils.

== Example Usage ==

ODL-SDNi App can be used for Bandwidth on demand across inter-SDN Federated Controllers

* In the multi-vendor environment, network traffic would need to be orchestrated across intra-/inter-domain subnets of the SDN controllers.
* The mandate is of a east-west communication that enables SDN controllers across subnets to exchange network information within the purview of defined policies
* Inter-SDN controller (multi-vendor) communication â€“ exchange of network parameters needs to be per pre-agree interface specifications
