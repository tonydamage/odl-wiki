IRC, or Internet Relay Chat, is often used as a real-time communication capability with open source projects. We're pretty proud of the friendly vibe in the OpenDaylightt channel and invite anyone wanting to ask questions or talk about all things OpenStack to the channel. 

IRC software can be found for all operating systems. The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients#Operating_system_support IRC clients comparison chart on Wikipedia] can help you pick one for your operating system

You don't have to have a complex setup to use IRC. You can use the web client for Freenode, which doesn't require any download or setup. Just pick a nickname and join #opendaylight: http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=opendaylight,opendaylight-ovsdb.
