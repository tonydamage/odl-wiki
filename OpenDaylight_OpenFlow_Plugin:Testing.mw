OpenFlow Plugin provides following features: 

1. Connection handshake with switches supporting 1.3 and 1.0 using OF Library API's.

3. Handled multiple connections from switches.
4. Handle multiple Auxiliary and Main connection from switches.
5. Role request.
6. Error handling.
7. Support OF CRUD operation for Flow, group, meter, stats, etc.

10. Handle and propagate switch events.

Openflow Plugin needs to be integrated with following modules:

1. Integration with Library.
2. Integration with MD-SAL.
3. Integration with Hard-SAL.

So each of the above integration scenario's will have different features to be tested.

1. Integration with Library
* Connection handshake with switch(Version bitmap and Hello message exchange.
* Capability exchange.
* Handle multiple connection.
* Handle TCP/TLS/UDP connection.
* Certificate Management though its Library functionality but still it would be good to do integration testing.
* Error Handling.
* Event Management.
* Packet processing.

2. Integration with MD-SAL
* Listening to
