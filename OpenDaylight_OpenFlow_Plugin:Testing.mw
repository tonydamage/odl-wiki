OpenFlow Plugin provides following features: 

 
# Connection handshake with switches supporting 1.3 and 1.0 using OF Library API's.
# Capability exchange with Switch.
# Handled multiple connections from switches.
# Handle multiple Auxiliary and Main connection from switches.
# Role request.
# Error handling.
# Support OF CRUD operation for Flow, group, meter, stats, etc.
# Packet processing.
# Support discovery service for topology.
# Handle and propagate switch events.

Openflow Plugin needs to be integrated with following modules:

1. Integration with Library.
2. Integration with MD-SAL.
3. Integration with Hard-SAL.
4. MD-SAL, Library and plugin integration.

So each of the above integration scenario's will have different features to be tested.

1. Integration with Library
* Connection handshake with switch(Version bitmap and Hello message exchange.
* Capability exchange.
* Handle multiple connection.
* Handle TCP/TLS/UDP connection.
* Certificate Management though its Library functionality but still it would be good to do integration testing.
* Error Handling.
* Event Management.
* Packet processing.

2. Integration with MD-SAL
* Registration of RPC method with MD-SAL.
* Routing the call to right RPC by MD-SAL.
* Switch notification from plugin to SAL.
* MD-SAL routing the notification to all registered modules.

3. Integration with Hard-SAL.

Will be same as "Integration with MD-SAL.

4. MD-SAL, Library and plugin integration.

All the above scenario 1 and 2 have to combined and tested.
