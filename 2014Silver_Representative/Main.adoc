=== Statement Of Interest

I am seeking a seat on the OpenDaylight Board of Directors to pursue the
interests of all Silver members, as well as the overall interests of
ODL. After participating in the OpenDaylight Summit, it was clear that
ODL will play an increasingly important role in the evolution of SDN.
Open source is at the forefront of an industry transformation driving
new technology adoption, in response to emerging use cases and
standards. The tremendous growth in ODL participation, especially among
new Silver Members, and strong collaboration set the stage for a highly
successful 2014. My extensive standardization experience with
progressive and highly community-oriented bodies (Open Networking
Foundation and ETSI NFV ISG) aptly prepares me for this unique role on
the ODL Board, which is to advocate for peer organizations spanning a
cross section of the industry. If elected the Silver Board member, I
intend to represent the Silver member collective interests, prevailing
over competitive forces and individual company interests. As the
Chairman of the ONF Market Education Committee (MEC), and an active
member of the ONF Council of Chairs (ONF leadership team), I have been
achieving those goals since the MEC was formed in late 2011. Since that
time, we have published the ONF SDN White Paper and 8 Solution Briefs
with diverse, inclusive, and highly collaborative project teams. I also
serve as the liaison between the ONF and Open Networking User Group, and
have organized highly successful workshops for the Open Networking
Summit, Layer123 for the SDN & OpenFlow World and APAC Congress events,
and SDN Central, where I have published the popular NFV Insider’s
series. Ciena recently announced that our Controller will be adopting
ODL, and has begun to contribute to the ODL in the integration area. We
are already gearing up to increase our contributions in 2014 and beyond.
With strong, senior-level corporate support, and both a company and
personal stake, I am committed to ODL success. Thank you for the
opportunity to ensure proactive and effective representation in the
interests of all Silver-level members.

Assets

* Proven track record for bringing together disparate organizations to
promote the greater industry goals
* Contemporary experience working with the ONF, ETSI NFV ISG, and ONUG
leadership teams
* Strong commitment to ODL with increasing code contributions and
ODL-based Controller product announcement
* Highly collaborative and pragmatic style that achieves diversity and
inclusiveness
* Extensive product management and product marketing background,
balancing both strategic and tactical considerations
* Strong executive-level backing throughout the company
* Professional and personal integrity

Leverage innovation in SDN by rich open source development experience

[[mathieu-lemay---inocybe-technologies]]
== Mathieu Lemay - Inocybe Technologies

[[bio-2]]
=== Bio

Mathieu Lemay is CEO of Inocybe Technologies a company specialized in
Smart & Sustainable IT Infrastructures. He is also CTO of Civimetrix
Telecom an infrastructure provider company specialized in democratizing
ultra-broadband Fiber to the Home (FTTH) as an economic development tool
for under-served communities.

Mathieu has more than 20 years of experience in information technology.
At the age of 10 he was programming C++, ADA and x86 ASM and then got
involved in networking from the early Bulletin Board Systems to the
first age of commodity Internet. He then pursued with a college,
bachelor and masters degree in Electrical Engineering with speciality in
Wireless and Optical Telecommunications.

In 2001, he started working at Communication's Research Centre (CRC) in
Canada where he worked on teams who pioneered User Empowered Networking
through directed research called User Controlled LightPaths (UCLP).
Still used in some research and education networks to provide
Network-as-a-Service (NaaS), it also inspired the Global Environment for
Network Innovation (GENI) initiative and some early Software Defined
Networks and Virtualization paradigms. In 2005, he founded Inocybe
Technologies to promote infrastructure multi-tenancy and simplicity.
While stronger evangelist of the Virtual Network Element model, Inocybe
has worked with OpenFlow since its inception at Stanford University and
partnered with local universities in a project called Netvirt which led
to the creation of the SDN startup called NoviFlow. In 2010, Inocybe
Technologies, CRC and École de Technologie Supérieure created the
world's first Zero Carbon Network where traffic and compute would move
based on site's renewable energy's availability and led to our
involvement in using a modified OpenStack distribution for Green Cloud
operations. Inocybe has joined OpenDaylight in June 2013 and has
launched its first OpenDaylight distribution at the February Summit.

[[statement-of-interest-2]]
=== Statement Of Interest

In our first OpenDaylight year we haven't been much involved. Inocybe is
very small company but we have worked on a developing a full technology
stack over the past 9 years of operations. As such, we had to finish
some missing pieces first. We are now eager to get involved and take the
required leadership to bring benefits to the entire community. It is the
reason why I am applying as a candidate for this Silver Member election.
We just recently got involved following our distribution release of
Inocybe OpenDaylight and we plan to be directly involved for the long
term. As the CEO of one of the smallest company in OpenDaylight, I think
I can bring other perspectives to the discussions and possibly make
things happen that are more difficult to execute in larger corporate
environments. Finally, through our FTTH deployments we also plan to
massively deploy OpenDaylight which is one of the reason that we strive
to help make OpenDaylight the best open-source SDN framework available.
I will promote help promote OpenDaylight as much as I can in my
partnerships and events.

=== Statement Of Interest

My employer, Huawei, is the leading ICT (information and communication
technology) company in China. Huawei treats open as its core value and
spares no efforts pushing for a wider adoption of international
standards and open source projects in China. Huawei is actively leading
or contributing in more than 100 international standard organizations
and open source communities. We observe the great value of Open Daylight
as the leading SDN community. Recently, Huawei built and opened “East
Test Lab” which allowed users around the world, especially those from
China, to try Open Daylight.

I want to serve on the Open Daylight Board of Directors. From this
position, Huawei not only strengthens our commitments in Open Daylight
community, but also increases the power when we negotiate with other
China companies for adopting and contributing to Open Daylight project.
