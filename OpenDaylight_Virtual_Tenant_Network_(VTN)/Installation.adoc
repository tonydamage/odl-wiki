VTN Coordinator runs outside of OpenDaylight Controller. On the other
hand, VTN Manager is implemented as OSGi bundles, and runs in
OpenDaylight Controller.

The requirements for these two are slightly different. Therefore, we
recommend that you install VTN Manager and VTN Coordinator in different
machines.
