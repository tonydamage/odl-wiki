= OpenDaylight Controller Driver (ODC Driver)

The ODC driver module is a sub component of the
OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):VTN_Coordinator[VTN
coordinator] and provides mechanisms to provision and monitor virtual
networks and monitor physical networks in the OpenDaylight controller.
ODC driver is started during startup of
OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):VTN_Coordinator[VTN
coordinator] It consists of two sub components

[[common-driver-framework-cdf]]
== Common Driver Framework (CDF)

CDF provides a controller independent processing of the messages sent
from
OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Unified Provider Logical Layer (UPLL)[UPLL]
and
OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Unified Provider Physical Layer (UPPL)[UPPL]
modules.

The main functions of this module are

:*Isolate the driver modules from processing messages sent by
OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Unified Provider Logical Layer (UPLL)[UPLL]
and
OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Unified Provider Physical Layer (UPPL)[UPPLmodules].

:*Provide interfaces to the driver module to install their commands for
various operations on the controller (eg: VTN creation).

:*Provide controller management and support different types of
controllers.

:*Parse Platform messages and invoke driver methods with appropriate
parameters.

:*Provide interface for different drivers to install command handlers.

:*Simplify transaction processing with simplified transaction functions
for Vote and Commit.

:*Support for Parallel Update operation across many controllers.

:*The framework can be extended to support all driver modules in a
common daemon or individual daemons.

CDF is implemented using the following modules

`      vtndrvintf` +
`      vtncacheutil`

[[vtndrvintf]]
=== vtndrvintf

:* Implements all the features of CDF as listed above.

[[class-details]]
==== Class Details

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Class Name |Description
|VtnDrvIntf |This class is inherited from Module class and provides the
entry point for messages from platform. This also provides interfaces to
add drivers for different types of controllers.

|KtHandler |Abstract interface for handling different message types.

|KtRequestHandler |Template that implements KtHandler to process all
messages from platform.

|DriverTxnInterface |Common Transaction handling for drivers

|ControllerFramework |This provides methods to add/delete/update
Controllers of different types to the VTN Coordinator. This also ensures
periodic monitoring of controllers and takes appropriate actions
|=======================================================================

[[vtncacheutil]]
=== vtncacheutil

:* Utility module that provides interfaces for caching configuration
entries to validate as a whole and then later commit

[[class-details-1]]
==== Class Details

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Class Name |Description
|keytree |cache container that provides interfaces to append config to
cache. |CommonIterator |Proves methods to iterate the elements in cache,
the option to iterate in VTN hierarchial order is also available.
|=======================================================================

[[odc-driver]]
== ODC Driver

:* The ODC driver module implements the interfaces for controller
connection management and virtual network provisioning and monitoring in
the ODC controller.

:* The request will be translated to the appropriate REST APIs and sent
to the controller.

:* Capable of translating the VTN Operations as Commands to VTN Manager
in the ODL.

The above features are implemented using these modules

`  restjsonutil` +
`  odcdriver`

[[restjsonutil]]
=== restjsonutil

:* Utility Module that provides services for json build/parse and
handling REST Request/Response.

[[class-details-2]]
==== Class Details

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Class Name |Description
|HttpClient |Interface to set up and maintain a connection to an HTTP
Web service

|RestClient |Interface to handle Request/Response on a REST Interface

|JsonBuildParse |Interface for building/parsing the json strings for
communication
|=======================================================================

[[odcdriver]]
=== odcdriver

:* Implements the interfaces exposed by CDF

:* Registers the driver for controllers of type : ODC (OpenDaylight
Controllers)

:* Uses the restjsonutil to communicate

[[class-details-3]]
==== Class Details

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Class Name |Description
|OdcModule |Module implementation of odc driver, registers itself as
diver for controllers of ODL type.

|ODCController |Implements the various methods according to the features
of the ODL Controller.

|ODCVTNCommand |Handle Create/Update/Delete/Read requests for VTN from
platform

|ODCVBRCommand |Handle Create/Update/Delete/Read requests for VBridge
from platform

|ODCVBRIfCommand |Handle Create/Update/Delete/Read requests for VBridge
Interfaces from platform.
