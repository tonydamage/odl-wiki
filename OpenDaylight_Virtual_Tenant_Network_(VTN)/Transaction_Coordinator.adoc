== Transaction Coordinator (TC)

The Transcation Coordiantor module implements the two phase commit
operation.

The main functions of this module are

:*TC is started from uncd daemon during startup of
OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):VTN_Coordinator[VTN
coordinator].

:*Responsible for two phase commit operation in VTN

:*Receives requests from
OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):VTN_API#VTN_Service_Java_API_library[VTN
service] during Commit and Audit operations.

:*Invokes lower layer
link:#Transaction_Coordinator_Library_(TCLIB)[TCLIB] API (i.e.
OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Unified Provider Logical Layer (UPLL)[UPLL]
API,
OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Unified Provider Physical Layer (UPPL)[UPPL]
API or
OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):OpenDaylight Controller Driver (ODC Driver)[ODC
Driver] API) via IPC framework.

[[transaction-coordinator-library-tclib]]
== Transaction Coordinator Library (TCLIB)

The main functions of this module are

:*TCLIB will be loaded as a module in
OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Unified Provider Logical Layer (UPLL)[UPLL],
OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Unified Provider Physical Layer (UPPL)[UPPL]
and
OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):OpenDaylight Controller Driver (ODC Driver)[ODC
Driver] daemon.

:*Responsible for handling messages to the daemons from
link:#Transaction_Coordinator_(TC)[TC].

:*The daemons will install their handler with TCLIB, the handlers will
be invoked on receiving messages from
link:#Transaction_Coordinator_(TC)[TC].
