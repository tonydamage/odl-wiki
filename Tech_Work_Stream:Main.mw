Meeting summary:

This was primarily a planning / kickoff meeting for the technical workstream to agree on meeting logistics and set a few topics for upcoming meetings (see the agenda slides for topics that were discussed).

* Agreed that we will have once per week meetings on Mondays at 1p PT (until we find that we need to change the scheduling).

* Dave Meyer (TSC chair) gave an overview of the Open Daylight developer track sessions at the recently concluded Open Networking Summit.

* Discussed some upcoming topics:
** next meeting will cover model-driven service abstraction layer
** Ericsson team agreed to present in upcoming weeks on proposed contributions
** Dell team agreed to provide an update on SDN standardization effort they are leading in OMG in upcoming weeks
** NEC team agreed to present an overview of their proposed project on Virtual Tenant Networking (VTN) in upcoming weeks
** Incorporating non-EPL code in Open Daylight :  The ODP board has commissioned a subcommittee to look at IPR and licensing issues.  Benson Schliesser agreed to report back to the technical workstream on this from the board.
** Discussion and agreement that tech workstream should tackle the issue of integrating non-Java code, driven by specific module use cases (e.g., Python CLI), or language use cases
** Colin Dixon, David Erickson and others to organize some discussions with contributing teams on a framework for resolving overlapping base controller codebases.  Will report back to the tech workstream as this progresses
