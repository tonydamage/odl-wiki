'''Release Readiness email''' sent to dev-lists & Project owners <br />
<br />
Hi Devs,<br />
<br />
Sorry about this lengthy email. Please spend a couple of minutes to go through this. This is EXTREMELY important for the release.<br />
<br />
As discussed during the TSC and the feverish work being done to get to the Release Readiness, we are tracking all the activities using :<br />
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoSzir1BfjyWdDQyVElWNG9mcWxhblREckZjbjFxUVE#gid=1<br />
<br />
This email is to take care of following 2 high priority items under "Global Code Cleanup" :<br />
- " Identify all places dependency versions in project pom.xml files are not current for all ODL Dependencies"<br />
- " Update dependency versions in all pom.xml files to current SNAPSHOT version for all ODL Dependencies"<br />
<br />
We have a jenkins job that is running on the controller project :  https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/controller/job/controller-version-changes/configure<br />
The "versions" plugin in this job will take care most of the work. It will find the LATEST dependency and also automatically submit a gerrit changes.<br />
How cool is that !!! ? : (Example Gerrit submission : https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/4149/)<br />

Based on our investigation, we have a simple Action Item for each of the project owners in each project :<br />
<br />
All you have to do as a project owner is to copy the above jenkins configuration into your own project and do the necessary modifications based<br />
on your project build needs. The most important maven option of interest :   (-B versions:use-latest-versions -DallowSnapshots=true).<br />
Also observe the execute shell commands which you would need for auto gerrit review.<br />

The goal is to bring down the dependency errors (https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/integration/job/integration-dependencyConvergence/1/console) to zero<br />
and let the integration project build to succeed.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

For the curious ones - more details :<br />
<br />
I pushed the Dependency-Convergence enforcer changes to integration branch earlier today : http://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/4189<br />
and this identifies all the dependencies that are not converged. <br />
We also have a jenkins job enabled in the integration project that will run daily once to keep track of these failures :<br />
https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/integration/job/integration-dependencyConvergence/<br />
<br />
Failures seen in the first run :<br />
https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/integration/job/integration-dependencyConvergence/1/console<br />

Please look for "Dependency convergence error" text in the above console log and this will give the hint on what are the failures that are currently active<br />
in each of the bundle. The goal is to bring this to 0 failures.<br />
