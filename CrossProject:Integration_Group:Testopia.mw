== Testopia Test Case Management ==

Testopia is a test case management extension for Bugzilla. It is designed to be a generic tool for tracking test cases, allowing for testing organizations to integrate bug reporting with their test case run results. Though it is designed with software testing in mind, it can be used to track testing on virtually anything in the engineering process.

'''Requirements'''
As our development has moved forward, we have decided to try to keep abreast of the latest stable release from Bugzilla (currently 3.4). This gives us a stable code base to work from. Developing plugins or extensions for any software is like trying to hit a moving target. This decision allows us to focus our time more on releasing new features often and early rather than back porting. However, this means that most major feature will not be back ported to earlier versions unless and until we have time to do so. Anyone wishing to help in this effort is more than welcome.

Bugzilla 3.6.x
Mysql 5.0 or PostGres 8.1.x
Mozilla compatible browser ;-)
Additional Perl Modules: Text::CSV XML::Schema Validator XML::Schema::Parser (for importer) and JSON 2.10

== Testopia for Integration ==

* We will use Testopia to document System Test (under product integration)
* Test Plans will be created for high level system features like SAL NSF, OpenFlow, NetConf, OVSDB, etc...
* Test Plans can be broken down into one or more Test Cases
* A Test Case is a collection of actions and conditions needed to verify a small feature or a sub-feature
* For debugging and clarity purposes, it is advisable to have many small Test Cases instead of one big Test Case
* Test Cases should run totally independent from each other. This will set the minimum for a Test Case 
* We will use Robot Framework to implement Test Plans and Test Cases
* A Test Plan will normally match a Robot suite which includes: setup/teardown file, one or more robot files
* A Test Case will normally match a Robot file which includes: setup/teardown statements, test step paragraphs as a collection of actions and conditions

== Testopia for Projects ==

* Projects can document their tests in Testopia as well (under product project)
* Test Plans will be created for projects features
* Test Plans can be broken down into one or more Test Cases
* A Test Case is a collection of actions and conditions needed to verify a small feature or a sub-feature
* For debugging and clarity purposes, it is advisable to have many small Test Cases instead of one big Test Case
* Test Cases should run totally independent from each other. This will set the minimum for a Test Case
