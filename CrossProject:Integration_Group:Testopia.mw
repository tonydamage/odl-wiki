== '''Testopia Test Case Management''' ==

Testopia is a test case management extension for Bugzilla. It is designed to be a generic tool for tracking test cases, allowing for testing organizations to integrate bug reporting with their test case run results. Though it is designed with software testing in mind, it can be used to track testing on virtually anything in the engineering process.

'''Requirements'''
As our development has moved forward, we have decided to try to keep abreast of the latest stable release from Bugzilla (currently 3.4). This gives us a stable code base to work from. Developing plugins or extensions for any software is like trying to hit a moving target. This decision allows us to focus our time more on releasing new features often and early rather than back porting. However, this means that most major feature will not be back ported to earlier versions unless and until we have time to do so. Anyone wishing to help in this effort is more than welcome.

Bugzilla 3.6.x
Mysql 5.0 or PostGres 8.1.x
Mozilla compatible browser ;-)
Additional Perl Modules: Text::CSV XML::Schema Validator XML::Schema::Parser (for importer) and JSON 2.10

== '''Use of Testopia for OpenDaylight CSIT''' ==

* Integration tests are provisioned under product integration
* We use Robot Framework to implement the Test Plans and the Test Cases documented in Testopia
* Test Plans are created to match Robot distribution test suites
* Test Categories are the Robot sub-suites that can run independently to test an specific controller functions like AD-SAL NSF, MD-SAL NSF, AD-SAL Apps, OVSDB or VTN
* Finally Test Cases are written to match the Robot test files that are in charge of testing a particular component or feature in Opendaylight like Topology Manager, Switch Manager, Flow Programmer, etcâ€¦
