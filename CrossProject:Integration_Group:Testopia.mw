Testopia is a test case management extension for Bugzilla. It is designed to be a generic tool for tracking test cases, allowing for testing organizations to integrate bug reporting with their test case run results. Though it is designed with software testing in mind, it can be used to track testing on virtually anything in the engineering process.

'''Requirements'''
As our development has moved forward, we have decided to try to keep abreast of the latest stable release from Bugzilla (currently 3.4). This gives us a stable code base to work from. Developing plugins or extensions for any software is like trying to hit a moving target. This decision allows us to focus our time more on releasing new features often and early rather than back porting. However, this means that most major feature will not be back ported to earlier versions unless and until we have time to do so. Anyone wishing to help in this effort is more than welcome.

Bugzilla 3.6.x
Mysql 5.0 or PostGres 8.1.x
Mozilla compatible browser ;-)
Additional Perl Modules: Text::CSV XML::Schema Validator XML::Schema::Parser (for importer) and JSON 2.10
