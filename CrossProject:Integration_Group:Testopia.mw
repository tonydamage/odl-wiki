== Testopia Test Case Management ==

Testopia is a test case management extension for Bugzilla. It is designed to be a generic tool for tracking test cases, allowing for testing organizations to integrate bug reporting with their test case run results. Though it is designed with software testing in mind, it can be used to track testing on virtually anything in the engineering process.

=== Requirements ===
As our development has moved forward, we have decided to try to keep abreast of the latest stable release from Bugzilla (currently 3.4). This gives us a stable code base to work from. Developing plugins or extensions for any software is like trying to hit a moving target. This decision allows us to focus our time more on releasing new features often and early rather than back porting. However, this means that most major feature will not be back ported to earlier versions unless and until we have time to do so. Anyone wishing to help in this effort is more than welcome.

=== Software Versions ===
* Bugzilla 3.6.x
* Mysql 5.0 or PostGres 8.1.x
* Mozilla compatible browser ;-)
* Additional Perl Modules: Text::CSV XML::Schema Validator XML::Schema::Parser (for importer) and JSON 2.10

=== Access to Testopia ===
Follow these steps get access to OpenDaylight Testopia:
* Login to Bugzilla using your ODL credentials 
* Send e-mail to Helpdesk (helpdesk@opendaylight.org) asking for Testopia access

== Testopia for Integration ==

* We will use Testopia to document System Test (under product integration)
* Test Plans will be created for high level system features like SAL NSF, OpenFlow, NetConf, OVSDB, etc...
* Test Plans can be broken down into one or more Test Cases
* A Test Case is a collection of actions and conditions needed to verify a small feature or a sub-feature
* For debugging and clarity purposes, it is advisable to have many small Test Cases instead of one big Test Case
* Test Cases should run totally independent from each other. This will set the minimum for a Test Case 
* We will use Robot Framework to implement Test Plans and Test Cases
* A Test Plan will normally match a Robot suite which includes: setup/teardown file, one or more robot files
* A Test Case will normally match a Robot file which includes: setup/teardown statements, test step paragraphs as a collection of actions and conditions

== Testopia for Projects ==

* Projects can document their Integration (and Unit) tests in Testopia as well (under product project)
* Test Plans will be created for projects features
* Test Plans can be broken down into one or more Test Cases
* A Test Case is a collection of actions and conditions needed to verify a small feature or a sub-feature
* For debugging and clarity purposes, it is advisable to have many small Test Cases instead of one big Test Case
* Test Cases should run totally independent from each other. This will set the minimum for a Test Case

== How to document a Feature Test ==

=== Create a Test Plan ===

Open bugzilla link: [https://bugs.opendaylight.org https://bugs.opendaylight.org]

Click on '''Product Dashboard'''

Browse for your project on the left menu:

<br/> [[File:Testopia.PNG|900px]] <br/><br/>

Select the '''Test Plans''' tab

Click on '''Create New Test Plan''' icon (top right), this will open a new window:

<br/> [[File:Testopia_TestPlan1.PNG|600px]] <br/><br/>

Fill in the following information:

* Plan name: the feature under test
* Plan Type: '''System''' for system test, '''Integration''' for PAX-EXAM IT, '''Unit''' for Unit Test, etc...
* Product Version: '''Hydrogen/Helium''' for Integration project, other projects can customize this field by issuing a ticket to LF Helpdesk

Press '''Submit''' button on bottom left corner to save changes

Once the Test Plan is created open it by clicking on its ID

Select '''Plan Documentation''' tab and fill any relevant test plan information

<br/> [[File:Testopia_TestPlan2.PNG|900px]] <br/><br/>

NOTE: Integration people, we will be at least filling the robot suite that implements the Test Plan and the setup/teardown information 

Press '''Submit''' button on bottom left corner to save changes

=== Create a Test Case for a Test Plan ===

On the Test Plan view, select the '''Test Cases''' tab

Click on '''Create New Test Case''' icon (top right), this will open a new window:

<br/> [[File:Testopia_TestCase1.PNG|900px]] <br/><br/>

Fill in the following information:

* Summary: the feature/sub-feature under test
* Priority: '''Normal''' or select other if applicable
* Category: '''Default''' for Integration project, other projects can customize this field by issuing a ticket to LF Helpdesk
* Status: '''PROPOSED''' if the Test Case has not been verified, '''CONFIRMED''' if it has been

Press '''Submit''' button on bottom left corner to save changes

Once the Test Case is created open it by clicking on its ID

Select '''Action/Expected Result''' tab and fill the sequence of actions/conditions to satisfy the Test Case

<br/> [[File:Testopia_TestCase2.PNG|900px]] <br/><br/>

NOTE: Integration people, we will be also filling the robot file that implements the Test Case

Finally select '''SetUp/BreakDown''' tab and fill any setup/teardown information if applicable

This is the basic instruction to document Feature Test, Testopia offers many other features and options collected in this on-line [https://bugs.opendaylight.org/extensions/Testopia/doc/Manual.pdf manual]
