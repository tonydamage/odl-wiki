https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5PxEM1eLszMuWf9M11AD5w7siT9vHOkzR85gjCB-6c/edit#gid=322436364
*Call mounted RPC calls via RestConf
*Binding Aware builders have been improved in terms of memory efficiency ( should be 48 bytes less)
*Stability issues and correctness issues fixed over last week – some coming from openFlow plugins
*100% testing all OF13 integration tests

'''What will be done (Whats planned):'''
*Bug 1010 - Return from Restconf the errors as defined in the ieft draft (Tom Pantelis)
*ietf-restconf (/modules and /streams) (Devin Avery)
*Netconf connector – return the netconf errors back in the rpc result (allow the RPC errors to be passed through). (Tom Pantelis)
*waiting on a parent patch.
*Bug 990, where enum types are not getting translated between binding aware / binding independent correctly - Martin is looking at these issues – The fix was merged just before the call. - Martin Bobak
*Datastore performance improvements (multiple patches, being submitted as we go) - restructures the data store for clarity. (Robert Varga)
*https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Controller:MD-SAL:Architecture:Clustered_Data_Store (https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1052)

'''Blocking Issues:'''
*https://ask.opendaylight.org/question/99/how-does-request-routing-works/  - Tony will follow
*If you have two different vendors, and you want to create a vlan, the consumer will issue the same command, how does it get routed to the correct plug based on the node. Is there some flag? -Tony and Shoaib will follow-up off line

'''Other Topics:'''
Any thing else big coming down the pipe?
*Clusting MD-SAL (How, when, architecture etc) - (Jake Samash) – Akka clusting, rest api’s, clustered data store. 
*Also clustering the features, so we could provide a registered OSGI service, and then deploy different features to different nodes and potentially cluster the controller.
