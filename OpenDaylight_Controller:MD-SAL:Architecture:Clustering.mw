<big>Option 1 : Invoking a remote shard using Rpc </big>

This first option does not assume the existence of Akka. With Akka some of these classes and interfaces will disappear. For example a Shard will itself be an actor and will thus not require a proxy and stub for access. In this Rpc option we're not drilling down too much into "How did the Sharded Data Store figure out where the other cluster members are?" The '''ClusterManager''' is a proxy for a component that provides that information to the Sharded Data Store
