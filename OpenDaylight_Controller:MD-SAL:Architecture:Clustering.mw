<big>Option 1 : Invoking a remote shard using Rpc </big>

This first option does not assume the existence of Akka. With Akka some of these classes and interfaces will disappear. For example a Shard will itself be an actor and will thus not require a proxy and stub for access. In this Rpc option we're not drilling down too much into "How did the Sharded Data Store figure out where the other cluster members are?" The '''ClusterManager''' is a proxy for a component that provides that information to the Sharded Data Store

== Open Questions/Random Thoughts ==


=== Moving a Shard/How to avoid moving a shard  ===

A clustered system starts up one member (process) at a time. When the very first member comes up it is not aware of any other existing members in a cluster. So it would probably have to assume that all shards are local. When the second member in a cluster comes up it needs to take ownership of some of the shards. This will involve (a) Informing member 1 of the intent to relocate the shard (2) The copying of all shard data from member 1 to member 2. 

Some questions,

# What happens when the shard is being moved? Do all transaction requests to that shard fail?
# What strategies can be used to avoid downtime
# Should the datastore have an “open for business” flag. That is only after all the nodes in the system are up and running will we start processing transactions?
# What happens if there are components which try adding data to the store before the store is open for business? There are certain components like topology manager which add some high-level nodes at startup. (It’s probably only one component)

=== Determining Shard location ===

It seems logical that to determine on which cluster member a Shard lives we need to know (a) some key based on which we can determine the location of a Shard and (b) A collection of cluster members. For a cluster member we may need to know for one the IP address of the member so that when we have to remotely invoke operations on a shard we can do so. 

Some questions,

# What hashing algorithm should we use to translate the inputs to provide us the location of the shard? Consistent Hashing seems like it would fit the bill - it should work fine if the cluster membership is relatively static and it could probably still be relevant when we move to a more dynamic cluster.
