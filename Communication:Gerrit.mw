== Recieving mail from Gerrit ==

To receieve mail directly from [https://git.opendaylight.org/ Gerrit] you must have registered an account with our [https://identity.opendaylight.org identity] system first. Then the first time you login to Gerrit it will acquire your primary email address from the identity system. You may add additional email addresses to the system by using the '''Register New Email''' link in your Gerrit user settings. You may then set an alternate email address as your preferred contact address instead of your primary from the drop down next to the button.

== Getting Gerrit mail for projects that do not have a dedicated mailing list ==

For projects that do not have dedicated <project>-gerrit@lists.opendaylight.org mailing lists the only way to get notice mail of changes is to setup project watches. This is a very powerful system that allows you to get mail on just the topics you actually care about, be they entire projects or just branches of projects.

Setting up a project watch is done in the following way:

In your personal settings for Gerrit select '''Watched Projects''' (highlight 1)

Enter the project you wish to monitor in the '''Project Name''' box (highlight 2)

If you have any specific sub searches enter then '''Only if''' box (highlight 3) NOTE: all standard [https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/Documentation/user-search.html Gerrit searches] can be used for the '''Only if'''

Press '''Watch''' (highlight 4)

Once the project has been added to your list you may select the options that you want to get mail for.

NOTE: Completely contrived setup for project watches to highlight how they can be used

In the case of this screen shot the integration project is watched for everything except Abandoned Changes (hightlight 5). Additionally the ovsdb project is watching the stable/hydrogen branch but only for Abandoned Changes (hightlight 6).

That's all there is to it. If you want to stop getting mail from a specific project all you need to do is check the box next to the project name and press the '''Delete''' button.

== Configuring Gerrit to watch all projects ==

If you desire to subscribe to all projects then for the '''Project Name''' use the special '''All-Projects''' group.
