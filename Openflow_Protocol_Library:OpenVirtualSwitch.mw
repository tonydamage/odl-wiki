= Open Virtual Switch =

* http://mininet.org - virtual network, based on ubuntu, using openvswitch driver
* http://openvswitch.org - driver for virtual openflow switch

== Usage ==
The easiest way to setup a virtual network of openflow switches is to run mininet virtual machine (based on ubuntu). When logged in the mininet VM various topologies of virtual network could be instantiated and also connected to controller.

* login to mininet VM (user '''mininet''', pwd '''mininiet''')
* start mininet 
 sudo mn --topo single,3  --controller 'remote,ip=<ControllerIP>' --switch ovsk
* play with mininet
 # print topology
 net
 # ping all hosts
 pingall
 # open xterm to host h1 (see topology)
 xterm h1
