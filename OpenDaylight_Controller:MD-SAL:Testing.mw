| One of most complicated paths if data were not written by Binding-Aware component. Mostly problematic are augments and cases in uses statements.

== Testing Tools ==

Currently for Testing we are using several approaches which are:

=== sal-test-model ===

Set of YANG models used for testing, currently defined models are for:

1. Common list pattern with augmentations - 2 level deep lists, with various testing augmentation
2. Normal RPC test model
3. Routed RPC test model
4. Ordering test model

=== MD-SAL Binding/DOM Based suite ===

This test tools are used for integration testing between DOM and Binding Data Format, tools are exported
as '''test-jar''' for '''sal-binding-broker'''.

* MD-SAL Test deployer - mostly for integration testing and legacy API support, where fully working MD-SAL is deployed
* Set of Abstract*Test used for unit testing of MD-SAL, may be used for unit testing of client code
:* AbstractSchemaAwareTest - test which loads yang schema from classpath and instantiates runtime codecs
:* AbstractDataBrokerTest - test which instantiates binding broker, dom broker and datastore
:* AbstractChangeListenerTest - variation of DataBroker test which has possibility for simple data change event testing


=== Restconf Testsuite ===

Current Restconf testing is done using JerseyTest, Mockito.

Jersey tests could be combined with Abstract*Test from MD-SAL to provide Java-based end-to-end integration and regression
testing between MD-SAL Binding and DOM formats to Restconf XML and JSON format.

== Existing MD-SAL / Restconf test suites ==

* sal-inmemory-datastore - Unit testing of inmemory datastore
* sal-binding-broker - Unit testing of binding broker implementation, integration 
* sal-binding-dom-it - Regression testing using mostly legacy APIs, with refactoring could be updated to integratation test suite for binding to dom in sal-binding-dom-it using sal-test-model.
