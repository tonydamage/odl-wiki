The OpenDaylight Project doesn't currently have a formal Code of Conduct.  We do, however, follow the general philosophy below when interacting with one another:

* be considerate, respectful, and collaborative
* community building is core to success
* open by default

Here are some pointers to various etiquette and code of conduct documents associated with other open source projects:

* Netiquette: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1855.txt
* OpenStack: http://www.openstack.org/legal/community-code-of-conduct/
* Fedora: http://fedoraproject.org/code-of-conduct
* Ubuntu: http://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/conduct
* Apache (doesn't have one, but references a community building draft): http://incubator.apache.org/guides/community.html
* Mozilla: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/policies/participation/
* GNOME: https://wiki.gnome.org/CodeOfConduct/
* Linux Kernel (wip): http://lwn.net/Articles/559061/
