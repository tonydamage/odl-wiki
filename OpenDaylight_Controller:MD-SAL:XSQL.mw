== What is XSQL? ==

In a nut shell, XSQL is a way to query tree models like they were a sequential database. For example, if your model looks like this:

  Network-Element
      Module
         Port 1/1
         Port 1/2
         Port 1/3
         Port 1/4
      Module
         Port 2/1
         Port 2/2
         Port 2/3
         Port 2/4

And you want to collect all the "Port" type elements from that model with all their attributes, your XSQL query will look like this:

  "select * from Port;"

The output will be a "table view" containing a row for each Port element with columns for all the attributes.
