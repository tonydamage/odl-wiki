== What is XSQL? ==

In a nut shell, XSQL is a way to query tree models like they were a sequential database. For example, if your model looks like this:

  Network-Element
      Module
         Port 1/1
         Port 1/2
         Port 1/3
         Port 1/4
      Module
         Port 2/1
         Port 2/2
         Port 2/3
         Port 2/4

And you want to collect all the "Port" type elements from that model with all their attributes, your XSQL query will look like this:

  "select * from Port;"

The output will be a "table view" containing a row for each Port element with columns for all the attributes.

== XSQL for MD-SAL ==
XSQL for MD-SAL is providing the same translation for the yang base models that persist data to the MD-SAL data store. A container would be a virtual table and a leaf would be a column in that table. For example if i would like to get a list of nodes from the inventory, i would execute the following query:
  select * from nodes/node;
The output to the screen would be something like the following:
  |serial-number|software|initial-capability|current-capability|description|id               |manufacturer|hardware    |connected|

== Adding XSQL to your distribution ==
XSQL project directory is located under the "controller/opendaylight/md-sal/sal-dom-xsql" directory, simply "cd" to the directory and execute "mvn clean install" to create the project ".jar" file to be used in the distribution. Once the jar was build, simply copy it from the "controller/opendaylight/md-sal/sal-dom-xsql/target" directory to your distribution "plugin" directory.
The startup configuration file can be found under the "controller/opendaylight/md-sal/sal-dom-xsql/src/main/resources" and it is named "04-xsql.xml". Copy this file to your distribution under the directory "configuration/initial" and execute the "run.sh" script to start your distribution.

== Start using XSQL ==
There are two way to use XSQL, the XSQL console & JDBC interface. Will start with the XSQL console...
The XSQL console is located @ port 34343, e.g. to connect to the console just telnet to that port, e.g.:
  telnet 0 34343
you'll get a prompt as follows:
  Trying 0.0.0.0...
  Connected to 0.
  Escape character is '^]'.
  XSQL>    

== Getting a list of Virtual Tables ==
To get a list of virtual tables, simply execute the following command:
  list vtables
The output will be a list of Virtual Tables for the different modules that are installed on the ODL and are using the data store.

== Getting a list of Virtual Fields ==
to get a list of virtual fields, simple execute the following command with the name of the table:
  list vfields <tables name>
The output will be a list of Virtual Fields in the Virtual Table.

== Quering ==
Try to execute the query @ the top of this page and see if you get a similar output...
Now let's try collecting all the "node-connectors" with the following query:
  "select * from nodes/node/node-connector;
The output should be something like:
  |port-number|id               |current-speed|current-feature     |maximum-speed|name    |supported|advertised-features|peer-features|hardware-address |configuration|

  |65534      |openflow:8:65534 |             |[]                  |             |s8      |[]       |[]                 |[]           |AA:4B:3E:14:22:44|[]           |
  |3          |openflow:8:3     |             |[pause, forty-gb-fd]|             |s8-eth3 |[]       |[]                 |[]           |92:1D:00:40:9F:BE|[]           |

Let's explicitly select only the id & the hardware-address:
  XSQL>select id,hardware-address from nodes/node/node-connector;
  |id               |hardware-address |
  -------------------------------------
  |openflow:9:1     |EA:CB:D5:22:B3:1A|
  |openflow:9:2     |62:D3:FA:BA:97:E3|
  |openflow:9:65534 |4E:0C:4B:73:38:40|
  |openflow:9:3     |46:F2:E2:56:C7:33|
  |openflow:8:65534 |AA:4B:3E:14:22:44|

And now let's add the node id so we will know to which node this node-connector belongs to:
  XSQL>select nodes/node.id,nodes/node/node-connector.id,hardware-address from nodes/node,nodes/node/node-connector;
  |id               |id               |hardware-address |
  -------------------------------------------------------
  |openflow:9       |openflow:9:1     |EA:CB:D5:22:B3:1A|
  |openflow:9       |openflow:9:2     |62:D3:FA:BA:97:E3|
  |openflow:9       |openflow:9:65534 |4E:0C:4B:73:38:40|
Note that because the field "id" exists in both virtual tables, i need to explicitly specify which id i refer to. Also note that there isn't any "join" statement here as the "join" is somehting inherited from the tree hierarchy structure of the data.

Now let's start filtering and select all the ports that has "FA" in their hardware-address:
  XSQL>select nodes/node.id,nodes/node/node-connector.id,hardware-address from nodes/node,nodes/node/node-connector 
       where nodes/node/node-connector.hardware-address like '%FA%';
  |id               |id           |hardware-address |
  ---------------------------------------------------
  |openflow:9       |openflow:9:2 |62:D3:FA:BA:97:E3|
  |openflow:3       |openflow:3:2 |B6:FA:AD:FE:47:1E|
  |openflow:11      |openflow:11:3|52:42:FA:E2:8B:FF|
  Total Number Of Records=3

== Exporting to CSV format file ==
You can specify to export the data to a CSV formatted file, do this by writing "tocsv" on the xsql prompt, e.g.:
  XSQL>tocsv
  to csv file is true

To return back to regular output to the screen, just write again "tocsv" and it will be turned off.

== Supported Syntax And Criteria Operands ==
The XSQL isn't fully ISO compatible to the SQL query, but it contains an initial syntax that supports querying and filtering data. If it will be picked up by the community, further implementation of the SQL ISO elements will be added depending on requirements and timelines. HOWEVER, let's review what is there...:o)

The basic syntax for XSQL query is as follows:
  '''Select''' <vfield list delimited by commas> '''from''' <list of vtables delimited by commas> '''where''' <criteria>''';'''

= vfields =
vFields can be specified by just using the name of the vfield if its distinguished enough in the query, for example: 
  select '''hardware-address''' from nodes/nodes/node-connector; 
or by specifiying the table name before it:
  select '''nodes/node/node-connector.hardware-address''' from nodes/node/node-connector;

The field name isn't case sensitive.

= vtables =

vTables names are also not case sensitive, you can use just the prefix of the table name if it is distinguished enough, for example:
  select * from node-connector;
Otherwise it is recommended to use the full table path to avoid confusion:
  select * from nodes/node/node-connector;

= Criteria =
The supported criteria operations are as follows:
  * "=" equale 
  *   "!=" not equale 
  *   ">" greater than 
  *   "<" less than 
  *   "<=" less or equale 
  *   ">=" greater or equale 
  *   "like" contains the following sub string 
  *   “and” to concatenate condition in an “and” condition. 
  *   “or” to concatenate condition in an “or” condition. 
  *  "is null" to specify if a vfield is "null".
  *  "not null" to specify if a vfield is not "null".

you can also use round brackets (e.g. "(" & ")"), but i am sorry to say i haven't tested it that good...:o)

== Using the JDBC ==
Using the JDBC is straightforward, just create a new java project in your favorite idea environment and add the XSQL ".jar" file as an imported library.
Once imported, here is a standard code for executing a XSQL query via JDBC:

  import java.sql.Connection;
  import java.sql.DriverManager;
  import java.sql.ResultSet;
  import java.sql.Statement;
  
  public class XSQLJDBCExample {
  	public static void main(String args[]){
  		Connection c = null;
  		Statement st = null;
  		ResultSet rs = null;
  		
  		try{
  			//Register the driver in the classloader
  			Class.forName("org.opendaylight.controller.md.sal.dom.xsql.jdbc.JDBCDriver");
  			//Get a new JDBC connection from the DriverManager
  			c = DriverManager.getConnection("127.0.0.1");
  			//Creste a JDBC statement
  			st = c.createStatement();
  			//Define the xsql query to execute 
  			String xsql = "select nodes/node.id,nodes/node/node-connector.id,flow-capable-node-connector-statistics.* from "+
  					      "nodes/node,nodes/node/node-connector,flow-capable-node-connector-statistics where hardware-address like '%FF%';";
  			//Execute the xsql query
  			rs = st.executeQuery(xsql);
  			//count the columns returned by the query
  			int colCount = rs.getMetaData().getColumnCount();
  			//printout a column title line, in this example i am formating to csv
  			System.out.print("\"");
  			for(int i=1;i<=colCount;i++){				
  				System.out.print(rs.getMetaData().getColumnLabel(i));
  				if(i<colCount)
  					System.out.print("\",\"");
  				else
  					System.out.println("\"\n");
  			}
  			
  			//Iterate over the records and print them out as csv format.
  			while(rs.next()){
  				System.out.print("\"");
  				for(int i=1;i<=colCount;i++){					
  					System.out.print(rs.getObject(i));
  					if(i<colCount)
  						System.out.print("\",\"");
  					else
  						System.out.println("\"\n");
  				}								
  			}
  			
  		}catch(Exception err){
  			err.printStackTrace();			
  		}finally{
  			if(rs!=null)try{rs.close();}catch(Exception err){}
  			if(st!=null)try{st.close();}catch(Exception err){}
  			if(c!=null)try{c.close();}catch(Exception err){}			
  		}
  	}
  }
