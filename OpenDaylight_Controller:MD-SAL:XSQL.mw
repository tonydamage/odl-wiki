== What is XSQL? ==

In a nut shell, XSQL is a way to query tree models like they were a sequential database. For example, if your model looks like this:

  Network-Element
      Module
         Port 1/1
         Port 1/2
         Port 1/3
         Port 1/4
      Module
         Port 2/1
         Port 2/2
         Port 2/3
         Port 2/4

And you want to collect all the "Port" type elements from that model with all their attributes, your XSQL query will look like this:

  "select * from Port;"

The output will be a "table view" containing a row for each Port element with columns for all the attributes.

== XSQL for MD-SAL ==
XSQL for MD-SAL is providing the same translation for the yang base models that persist data to the MD-SAL data store. A container would be a virtual table and a leaf would be a column in that table. For example if i would like to get a list of nodes from the inventory, i would execute the following query:
  select * from nodes/node;
The output to the screen would be something like the following:
  |serial-number|software|initial-capability|current-capability|description|id               |manufacturer|hardware    |connected|

== Adding XSQL to your distribution ==
XSQL project directory is located under the "controller/opendaylight/md-sal/sal-dom-xsql" directory, simply "cd" to the directory and execute "mvn clean install" to create the project ".jar" file to be used in the distribution. Once the jar was build, simply copy it from the "controller/opendaylight/md-sal/sal-dom-xsql/target" directory to your distribution "plugin" directory.
The startup configuration file can be found under the "controller/opendaylight/md-sal/sal-dom-xsql/src/main/resources" and it is named "04-xsql.xml". Copy this file to your distribution under the directory "configuration/initial" and execute the "run.sh" script to start your distribution.
