After a release of OpenDaylight (e.g., Hydrogen, Helium, Lithium) it is
necessary for all project create a stable/ branch to support bug fixes
in both the master branch and any stable branch. This page walks the
reader through how to do this, using the gerrit and jenkins web
interfaces and the OpenDOVE project as a sample. _Note: this document
was based on OpenDaylight Controller:Setting Up Stability Branches[this
page] orignially developed for the Hydrogen release._

[[step-1-bump-the-versions-on-your-master-branch]]
=== Step 1: Bump the versions on your master branch

* The goal of this step is to change all versions of the form
"x.y.z-SNAPSHOT" or "x.y-SNAPSHOT" to "x.(y+1).0-SNAPSHOT"
* To do this, make sure you're on the master branch:

-----------------------------------------------
ckd$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
-----------------------------------------------

* This can be easily accomplished by downloading and running this
script:
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/gitweb?p=releng/autorelease.git;a=blob;f=scripts/version.sh;h=9a707aae31ed96588949cd68c3a8ac1ba1321e21;hb=HEAD[version.sh]
** For example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
spectre-3:ttp ckd$ chmod u+x ~/Downloads/version.sh 

spectre-3:ttp ckd$ ~/Downloads/version.sh bump Lithium
Bumping versions...

spectre-3:ttp ckd$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   distribution-karaf/pom.xml
    modified:   features/pom.xml
    modified:   features/src/main/resources/features.xml
    modified:   parser/pom.xml
    modified:   pom.xml
    modified:   ttp-model/pom.xml

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Verify that the changes look correct using `git diff`
* Commit and then push to the master branch in gerrit, e.g.,

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
git commit -asm "Incrementing versions by 0.1.0 for post-<release-name> master branch"
git review
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Review and merge the patch in gerrit

[[step-2-create-branch-in-gerrit]]
=== Step 2: Create branch in Gerrit

In https://git.opendaylight.org[Gerrit]:

1.  click Projects
2.  Then click List
3.  Then click your project from the list
4.  Then Branches at the top +
image:Stability Screenshot1.png[Stability Screenshot1.png,title="fig:Stability Screenshot1.png"]
5.  At the bottom, enter "stable/" and the revision (branch or hash) to
branch from
* The should be lower case of the relese, e.g., hydrogen, helium,
lithium, so the new branch name would be stable/lithium or the like
* The revision should either be the hash of the last patch _before_ your
version bump patch on master.
** You should be able to find that by browsing to the gerrit URL for the
master version bump patch and looking for the hash of its parent.
** For example, the
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/20448/[version bump patch for
TTP is here] and you can see that it's parent is
cb9e6054a7832c0228e5f29cd1a5f19cf6663d02 +
image:Parent_Screenshot.png[Parent_Screenshot.png,title="fig:Parent_Screenshot.png"]
** and so creating the stable/helium branch will look like this: +
image:Stability Screenshot2.png[Stability Screenshot2.png,title="fig:Stability Screenshot2.png"]

[[step-3-create-new-jenkins-jobs-for-the-stability-branch]]
=== Step 3: Create new Jenkins Jobs for the Stability Branch

Confirm with Gerrit that there is not already a patch to releng/builder
for your project:

`   `https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/q/project:releng/builder+status:open[`https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/q/project:releng/builder+status:open`]

If not then follow these steps:

1.  Clone releng/builder
* git clone https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/releng/builder
2.  Modify /jjb//.cfg and add the new stability branch to BRANCHES
* See:
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/RelEng/Builder/Jenkins#Tuning_templates
3.  Submit patch to releng/builder for review

`   git add jjb/``/``.cfg` +
`   git commit -sm "Add stable/`` jobs for ``"` +
`   git review`

For example: https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/19054/

Jenkins will create an automatic patch for the new jobs, be ready to +1
the changes.

[[step-4-update-your-.gitreview-file]]
=== Step 4: Update your .gitreview file

* Update your .gitreview fie so that git review will point to the
stable/, e.g., stable/lithium, branch
** NOTE: make sure you are on the stable/, e.g., stable/lithium, branch
before doing this
* Do this by adding a line saying `defaultbranch=stable/<release-name>`
** For example, the TTP .gitreview file for lithium looks like:

----------------------------
[gerrit]
host=git.opendaylight.org
port=29418
project=ttp.git
defaultbranch=stable/lithium
----------------------------

* Commit this change and submit it to gerrit like so:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
git commit -asm "Changing .gitreview to use the stable/<release-name> branch"
git review
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Make sure that this patch went to the stable/lithium branch in
gerrit: +
image:Showing-gitreview-working.png[Showing-gitreview-working.png,title="fig:Showing-gitreview-working.png"]
* Merge the patch in gerrit

[[step-5-how-to-cherry-pick-patches-from-master-to-a-stability-branch-via-gerrit]]
== Step 5: How to Cherry Pick Patches from Master to a Stability Branch
via Gerrit

1.  Select the patch that you want to cherry pick from Master to Stable
Branch
2.  Locate the Cherry Pick To button +
image:Stability_Screenshot9.png[Stability_Screenshot9.png,title="fig:Stability_Screenshot9.png"]
3.  Start to type in "re" in the branch text box to get suggestions to
appear, then select "refs/heads/stable/" +
image:Stability_ScreenShot10.png[Stability_ScreenShot10.png,title="fig:Stability_ScreenShot10.png"]
4.  Click Cherry Pick Change +

[[step-xxx-resolving-cyclic-dependencies]]
== Step XXX: Resolving Cyclic Dependencies

For some projects, there are dependencies in both directions. Current
examples include:

* Between controller and aaa (dependency in a feature test)
* Between l2switch and dlux (dependency in a distribution)
* Between openfowplugin and dlux (dependency in a distribution)

The current approach here is described in
https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/controller-dev/2014-October/006787.html[this
e-mail] and repeated here:

1.  We only allow run-time dependencies, e.g., via features or
distributions
2.  When you need to resolve the cycle, i.e., the two reasons above, you
temporarily either stop building the relevant distribution(s) or stop
running the relevant feature tests.
3.  After you've passed through the cycle you immediately re-enable
them.

As an example, here is how we are resolving it in 3 patches between
controller and AAA:

*
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/11731/[https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/11731/]
** controller patch that bumps all version but aaa.version and disables
feature tests that include aaa
*
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/11750/[https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/11750/]
** normal patch that bumps all versions in the aaa project
*
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/11732/[https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/11732/]
** controller patch that bumps aaa.version and re-enables the feature
tests that include aaa

An analogous thing will have to be done for the dlux, l2switch, and
openflow plugin cluster.
