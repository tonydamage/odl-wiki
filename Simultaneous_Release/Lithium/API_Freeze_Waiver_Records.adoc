===== Description of the API Change and Rationale

When new BindingCodecTreeNode API was introduced, which provided
low-level access to codec implementation, path argument serialization
was ommised from public interfaces, even if it was already implemented.
As it turned out this functionality is useful for projects, which wants
to manually use of serialiazation / deserialization between Binding and
DOM.

** +1 - addition of these methods will not affect controller project in
any way, but allows us to optimize translation of some events.

Event source SPI simplifies that by providing EventSourceRegistry which

[[description-of-the-api-change-and-rationale-2]]
===== Description of the API Change and Rationale

The DataTreeChange API is a new API in Lithium, created to fix
performance issues with DataChangeNotification APIs that the users have
been seeing with Helium. BGPCEP's BGP Topology Provider is one such
user, but it needs the ability to glean the before-state when an object
is deleted to construct cross-reference keys into the network topology
it maintains based on the observed data changes. Without this ability,
topology provider as well as other users would have to retain state in
the form of Map tracking the cross-reference keys for the lifetime of an
object -- adding complexity and increasing resource usage for the
steady-state.

[[description-of-the-api-change-and-rationale-3]]
===== Description of the API Change and Rationale

The Data Tree API and its reference implementation provide the
foundational MVCC data tree on top which the MD-SAL Data Store
implementations are based. As part of the normal modification, data tree
implementation produce DataTreeCandidate, which is an object capturing
the impact of a set of modification being applied in a compact delta
form. This form is suitable for replication purposes, but unfortunately
the current APIs allow for a single useful instance to exist for any
particular data tree instance. That effectively prevents its use in
asynchronous environments, as the data tree mutation is dominated by
round-trip times.

As it turns out, the reference implementation is able to trivially
support a sequence of outstanding DataTreeCandidates with minimal
changes, alleviating the usability problem. The impact of the change is
limited to backwards-compatible shift of two methods into new
interfaces.

The extraction of the linkstate-path-attribute to a grouping ensures
that an object with the same namespace can be reused when
parsing/serializing this attribute and when storing it in the topology.
This is needed for the new RIB that we're working on, as this is the
first time this attribute gets stored in datastore.

tell the Local RIB to make sure no extra identifiers go missing.

===== Description of the API Change and Rationale

Putting a container within the path-attributes grouping ensures that an
object with the same namespace can be reused when parsing/serializing
this attribute and when storing it in the datastore. It's needed for
getting linkstate extension to work, as linkstate introduces new Path
attribute, which couldn't be copied to the original container without
this change.

This essentially also changes some augmentation paths in following
models: bgp-flowspec.yang, bgp-linkstate.yang, bgp-rib.yang

Binding specification v1 was originally designed and implemented with
only one implementation of DTO interfaces in mind, which were generated
one. During Helium alternative implementation (LazyDataObject) was
introduced, but specification and generated copy builder constructor did
not accounted for that change to allow copy of augmenations.

Introduced interface allows for custom implementations to behave in same
fashion as generated DTOs, once when used together.
