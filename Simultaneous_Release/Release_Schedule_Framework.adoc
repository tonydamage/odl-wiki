This is a living document to capture required elements needed in
OpenDaylight Simultaneous Release plans. It has been most recently
updated for the Lithium release.

== Current General Guidelines and Justifications

* In general the deadline and/or start of builds should take place
23:59:59 UTC on the date listed. That is either 4p or 5p pacific time
depending on daylight savings time. During the Helium release, this
seems to work well in general.
* Deadlines are currently set to Friday because this allows for both 2
days worth of "free" slack over the weekend in case people need it and
gives time for information to be collected and reported to the TSC on
Thursday.
* If offsets are used, there is a much longer time between M5 and RC0
than might normally make sense, but this time can be productively used
for the early offset projects to do extra testing and revisions.

[[schedule-outline]]
== Schedule Outline

* M0
** Call to open the release
** Duration dependent on technical debt cleanup and/or other activities
necessary between the end of one release the start of the next.
** The M0 date should be no sooner than the TSC approves the release
plan and allow adequate time for projects to complete M1 deliverables
* M1
** Deadline for projects to declare their participation in the release
** Each project must have a candidate release plan
** Each project must have an elected project lead
** The time between M1 and M2 is intended to be used to meet M2
requirements
*** This includes fleshing out the release plan with cross-project API
negotiations
* M2
** Final project-specific release plan including:
*** Deliverables (with target Milestone for completion)
*** Explicitly called out *Provisional APIs*: New or Modified Externally
Consumable APIs
**** including function/RPC/notification names, input and output
parameters, description of functionality and/or pseudocode, etc.
**** Some of these APIs can be marked as *Tentative APIs* indicating
that they will be provided in a best effort manner, but may not make the
final relese
*** Dependencies on other projects' *Provisional APIs*
**** These dependencies should be codified, reviewed and acknowledged by
both projects
**** Requested new or changed APIs (if any) should be documented as part
of the process, acknowledged and added to the providing project's
release plan
**** If projects are at the same offset, the negotiation should include
if the APIs need to be provided earlier than strictly required
*** Planned deprecated/end-of-life functionality and APIs
**** Note that a *Legacy API* that has not previously been deprecated by
only be deprecated. An API which has been previously deprecated can
end-of-lifed and removed during the release.
*** There should be release plan reviews at least at M2 (and possibly
M1) where the TSC is encouraged to attend (as with release reviews)
** Infrastructure set up
*** These tasks are outlined in the
GettingStarted:Project_Main#New_Project_Checklist[New Project Checklist]
and apply to _all_ projects not just new ones
*** gerrit w/git repository
*** jenkins jobs (-verify, -merge, -integration) set up and tested
*** bugzilla
*** mailing list
*** wiki page using the Project Facts template
*** pom files set up
*** unit tests reporting code coverage
** Integration group must have provided instructions and requirements
for projects to start on system/integration tests by M3
*** These will be reviewed by the TSC
** Documentation group must have provided instructions and requirements
for projects to start on documentation by M3
*** These will be reviewed by the TSC
* M3
** *Functionality Freeze:*
*** Projects will say whether the will be able to provide each TENTATIVE
API or not
*** Reconcile failure to meet requested APIs (whether TENTATIVE, or
otherwise) here
** Karaf features defined and in integration
** Documentation started
*** _Note: The documentation group will provide instructions and
requirements at M2 as listed above._
**** Suggested requirements:
***** Kinds of documentation identified and asciidoc files created so
that they can be imported into the docs project
***** Some minimum word count requirement???
*** One project representative attending weekly documentation meetings
** System/Integration test dialog started
*** _Note: The integration group will provide instructions and
requirements at M2 as listed above._
**** Suggested requirements:
***** One system test sketched out for every project???
***** A target code coverage from unit tests???
*** One project representative attending weekly integration meetings
* M4
** *API Freeze*
* M5
** *Code Freeze*
*** As part of code freeze, projects should cut a stability branch and
only bug fixes should go to this branch
**** To prevent overlapping artifacts from being pushed, the master
branch version needs to be updated as well
**** TODO: This whole process should be carefully documented and
automated based on our current
Simultaneous Release:Cutting Stability Branches[release cutting
documentation]
** *String Freeze*
** TSC identifies a date and time at which the autorelease for RC0 will
be launched
* RC0
** This _must_ be 4 weeks after M5 to allow for *offset two* projects to
make it to *Code Freeze* and *String Freeze*
** It _may_ want to be 5 or 6 weeks after to allow for RC planning after
those freezes
** TODO: we want a process for filing blocking bugs. Both in bugzilla
and in a spreadsheet???
** TODO: before we get here, we need to set a date/time for RCs to be
cut
** TSC identifies a date and time at which the autorelease for RC1 will
be launched
* RC1
** TSC identifies a date and time at which the autorelease for RC2 will
be launched
* RC2
* Release
