[[introduction]]
== Introduction

This is a Simultaneous Release Plan for the Lithium release of
OpenDaylight. Note that it is the third release plan and marks a
somewhat significant departure from the previous two. As a consequence,
please read it carefully to understand the requirements to participate
and for each milestone.

Projects may choose to participate or not based upon their readiness and
desire to join the Simultaneous Release. This plan is structured as laid
out in the OpenDaylight
http://www.opendaylight.org/project-lifecycle-releases[Project
Lifecycle].

[[definitions]]
== Definitions

* *APIs:* For the purposes of being declared *Stable*, *Provisional*, or
*Tentative*, an API is a collection of code that provides some
high-level functionality, e.g., flow programming or MD-SAL data store
access. When listed on a release plan, APIs should be given a short
name, classified into one of the three categories, and have the
supporting bundles (if/when they exist) listed as well.
** *Stable API:* An API that can be accessed external to your project,
existed in a previous version of ODL, and will continue to exist in the
current version of ODL with no changes. By definition, all Stable APIs
are frozen throughout this entire release cycle. Note that all APIs are
assumed to be *Stable APIs* unless called out as *Provisional* and/or
*Tentative* in a release plan.
** *Provisional API:* An API that can be accessed external to your
project and is introduced in the current release, or an externally
accessible API that existed in a previous version of ODL but is being
modified for the current release.
** *Tentative API:* A *Provisional API* that will be provided in a best
effort manner, but which may or may not be delivered in the final
release. The Go/NoGo status of Tentative APIs must be made by M3.
* *Functionality Freeze:* No new externally visible functionality is to
be added to the current release of ODL. All provisional APIs are at
least functional (at a beta-quality level) if not yet fully tested.
* *API Freeze:* All externally accessible APIs (Stable and Provisional)
may not be modified. An API exception process (similar to
Simultaneous Release:Helium:Suggestions for Post API Freeze Exception Handling[the
one used in helium]) will allow for critical changes to APIs after API
freeze with the consent of the consuming projects. APIs include, but are
not limited to, all Java classes/interfaces declared public and exported
from an OSGi bundle, all YANG models, all Karaf feature names/locations,
and all REST/RESTCONF calls including the full URL with options.
* *Code Freeze:* No new features/functionality are to be allowed into
the current release. Only errors/bugs identified in the bugzilla system
are allowed. The exceptions to this include new tests, and
documentation. Distribution (Karaf) packaging must be complete.
Errors/bugs found after Code Freeze are still bugs and they may be
created and worked on. This includes packaging bugs found as well.
* *String Freeze:* All text strings used within ODL may not be changed.
Final documentation and localization teams may rely on these strings not
changing for the current release.
* *Release Candidate (RC):* A fully-built, complete version of the
current ODL release. This includes all code, documentation, and
packaging that make up the final user-deliverable set of artifacts.
After RC0, new RCs will be continually built, e.g., once per day, to
enable rapid testing and fixing of bugs.
** Note that this definition makes the dates for RCs and the final
release as targets, but they may need to be adjusted based on project
readiness and any remaining blocking bugs.
** The notion of RC#s will remain to aid in planning when bug fixes are
expected.
** During the RC process blocking bugs will be tracked both on a
spreadsheet and in bugzilla.
** During the RC process regular, e.g., daily, meetings will be held on
IRC to identify and address critical issues as they arise.

[[project-offsets]]
=== Project Offsets

Projects are classified into one of 3 offsets:

* *offset zero:* deadlines are at the dates listed
* *offset one:* deadlines are _generally_^link:#note1[1]^ at the listed
dates + 2 weeks
* *offset two:* deadlines are _generally_^link:#note1[1]^ at the listed
dates + 4 weeks
** _Note that the intent is that offset two projects have no other
projects depending on them in this release_

This is intentionally flattening the the actual dependency graph

* The full project-level graph is at least 8 levels
** e.g., odlparent => yangtools => controller => openflowjava =>
openflowplugin => sfc => ovsdb => groupbasedpolicy
* The idea is to hit an 80/20 point where projects can have some lag to
get new APIs from those they depend on
** If projects are in the same offset but need APIs from each other this
should be noted and planned (possibly by asking for them sooner than
would be required) as part of the API request negotiation at M2

The intent is for projects that form key infrastructure of all other
projects (e.g., odlparent, yangtools, and controller) to operate at
*offset zero*, projects which provide key network services (e.g.,
OpenFlow and OVSDB) to operate at *offset one*, and projects that others
don't depend on to operate at *offset two*.

^1^Deadlines for *Release Candidates* (RC0, RC1 and RC2) and the release
are the same regardless of offset. Deadlines for M1 and M2 are offset by
+1 week and +2 weeks. Full details can be found in the dates listed in
the link:#Schedule[Schedule] table.

[[requirements-for-participation]]
== Requirements for Participation

In order to participate in the simultaneous release, a project must do
the following things.

1.  Planning
* Projects must declare their intent to participate in the Simultaneous
Release by M1. This is accomplished by adding the project to the table
in link:#Participating_Projects[participating projects] and sending the
first milestone readout mail.
* Participating projects must publish a candidate Release Plan by M1 and
declare their final Release Plan by M2
** Participating project Release Plans must contain Milestones that
minimally line up with the Simultaneous Release Plan Milestones
** Per-project release plans now include sections for cross-project
negotiation of provided APIs and for noting cross-project
incompatibilities.
*** Projects are required to negotiate cross-project dependencies for
any new or modified APIs.
*** Projects are encouraged to think about and cross-project
incompatibilities and how to resolve them, if possible, as part of their
release plans.
2.  Leadership & Communication
* Each project must elect a Project Lead as described in the
http://www.opendaylight.org/project/tsc/charter[TSC charter], section 7.
** Phil Robb will help projects with this process and it must be
completed by M1.
** The results of the election, and other changes to the project lead
during this release, should be reported by
1.  Updating the project facts template for the project on its main wiki
page
2.  Updating the link:#Participating_Projects[participating projects]
table of this release
3.  Sending an e-mail the -dev,
mailto:release@lists.opendaylight.org[release], and
mailto:tsc@lists.opendaylight.org[tsc] lists
* The Project Lead is expected to be responsible for the the project
meeting deadlines, interacting with other projects, and interacting with
the TSC
* The Project Lead will be subscribed to the
mailto:release@lists.opendaylight.org[release mailing list] and must
respond to requests send to the a timely fashion—defined as 48 hours
excluding weekends.
** If a Project Lead is not be able to do so, they should (i) have
somebody else stand in and do this on their behalf, (ii) send a mail to
the mailto:release@lists.opendaylight.org[release mailing list]
indicating this and the time period, and (iii) note the same information
in the participating projects section of the release plan.
* All release-critical correspondence that requires a response will have
a subject line containing "PLEASE RESPOND BY "
** Please limit traffic to correspondence directly relating to the
release
** The TSC should collect response time metrics for projects both to
inform our planning and to measure project maturity going forward.
3.  Service Release Participation
* All projects participating in the release are also required to
participate in the two stability releases after the formal release.
4.  Modularity
* Modules that are not intended to interface with the controller via
REST/other non-Java RPC mechanism must be OSGi bundles.
* OSGi bundles should be reasonably granular.
* OSGi bundles should be grouped into Karaf features by M3 including
possibly defining some features as user-facing.
5.  Quality
* No later than M2, each project must have a "-verify" Jenkins Job which
verifies that the project builds and passes test for each new patch
pushed to gerrit.
* No later than M2 as part of the Gerrit/Jenkins merge process, i.e.,
the Jenkins "-merge" job, participating projects must push their binary
artifacts to the Nexus repository
* No later than M2, each project must have a Jenkins Job which rebuilds
and retests to an appropriate level when a project it depends on
publishes new artifacts, i.e., a Jenkins "-integration" job.
* No later than M2, each project primarily written in Java must be
reporting unit test coverage via sonar.
** Projects, especially ones that form key infrastructure for other
projects, are strongly encouraged to set goals for code coverage and
reported bugs. Doing so will be seen favorably when evaluating projects
for advancement in the
http://www.opendaylight.org/project-lifecycle-releases Project Lifecycle[http://www.opendaylight.org/project-lifecycle-releases
Project Lifecycle].
6.  Testing
* In addition to setting up appropriate Jenkins -verify, -merge, and
-integration jobs by M2, projects are expected to provide adequate unit,
integration and system tests.
* The coverage provided by unit tests and integration tests should be
reported to sonar by M2.
* Participating projects must describe one system test per user-facing
feature by M3 and have those system tests running on or after each
-merge job by M5.
* Further details and requirements can be found in the
link:#Schedule[schedule] below as well as the
CrossProject:Documentation Group:Lithium Project Documentation Requirements[Lithium
Project Documentation Requirements].
7.  Documentation
* Each participating project is expected to identify the kinds of
documentation that would be useful (e.g., installation guide, user
guide, developer guide) and provide them as part of the release.
* More details on the expectations can be found in the
link:#Schedule[schedule] below as well as the
CrossProject:Integration Group:Lithium Project Integration Requirements[Lithium
Project Integration Requirements].
8.  Code Hygiene
* No uses of System.out.println in non-test code.
* No dependencies on 3rd party (non-ODL) snapshot versions
* Willing to use agreed-upon versions for dependencies (both 3rd party
and ODL), i.e., to eliminate version skew
9.  Distribution
* All projects must support a Karaf-based distribution model including
defining Karaf features no later than M3.
10. Meeting Deadlines
* All projects are expected to meet the deadlines laid out in the
link:#Schedule[schedule] below.
** To indicate this, the project lead/contact is expected to provide
send a milestone readout to the
https://lists.opendaylight.org/mailman/listinfo/release[release mailing
list] by 23:59:59 UTC on the date listed for the the appropriate offset
at each milestone.
** Most information will be communicated by filling out appropriate
information in the
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KPpO9LH539Vlcoa4RvLa6PPCdLifi5JD-ihRhlybqeo/edit#gid=1196332566[release
tracking spreadsheet], but a mail should still be sent indicating that
the information has been filled in. Any other information or questions
can be included in that mail.
* If a project cannot make a deadline, the project lead/contact must
write a summary of what was missed, why, the course correction that will
be taken, and it's impact on other projects.
** For *offset two* project this is mainly intended to be reflective and
to help inform the release process.
** For *offset zero* and *offset one* projects, this should be completed
with 24 hours of missing the deadline and must be presented to the TSC
at the first TSC meeting after the deadline.
* All Milestone deliverables will be verified by the Lithium release
management staff and/or the TSC.
** _NOTE: For deliverables defined only in the project's release
plan—and not as a requirement in this document—the release management
staff and/or TSC will verify that the status of the deliverables has
been reported. Lithium release management staff and/or the TSC may also,
but are not required to, verify the delivered functionality._

[[milestones-release-candidates-and-service-releases]]
== Milestones, Release Candidates, and Service Releases

* Milestones are spaced roughly 4 weeks apart taking into account
significant holidays.
* Release Candidates (RC) are spaced 2 weeks apart
* Service Releases are roughly 6 weeks and 12 weeks after the Formal
Lithium Release.

|=======================================================================

^3^Please note that the TSC reserves the right to allow projects to
enter the Simultaneous Release for a reasonable period of time after the
M1 date. For example, the TSC may allow additional time if a project is
delayed by the IPR Review process.

^4^Projects running system tests outside the OpenDaylight CI
infrastructure are not required to run system tests and report the
results on "-merge" and "-integration" Jenkins jobs, although if they
can this is ideal. They are required to report system test results in a
timely fashion after release creations, e.g., weekly, RC, and formal
releases.

Please also note that projects that would like to spin out parts of
themselves into additional projects may have those new projects join the
Simultaneous Release at any point prior to M3 provided:

1.  The TSC has been informed of this intent prior to M3
2.  The original project's release Release Plan is apportioned between
the original and new projects with no parts missing
3.  The new projects have been proposed and approved by the TSC into one
of the non-proposed life-cycle states in the normal manner by M3
4.  The new projects have completed the requirements for all milestones
before they joined the release, e.g., M1 and/or M2

Lastly, note that as the new projects are joining the release prior to
M3, they must meet all the requirements for M3 at the normal time.

[[communication-channels]]
== Communication Channels

[[mailing-list]]
=== Mailing List

The https://lists.opendaylight.org/mailman/listinfo/release[release
mailing list] (release@lists.opendaylight.org) is the formal channel for
communication about the Simultaneous Release.

Please limit mail to this list to things that directly concern the
release as our goal is to keep it's volume at a level that allows the
project lead/contact to read all of it.

[[per-project-simultaneous-release-contact]]
=== Per-project Simultaneous Release Contact

Each project participating in the Simultaneous Release should designate
a committer to be the contact for that project for that Simultaneous
Release. It is expected that this be the project lead for most projects.
Even though a primary contact other than the project lead can be
designated, the project lead is still expected to be ultimately
responsible for the project's participation in the release.

[[cross-project-milestone-and-release-candidate-reporting]]
=== Cross Project Milestone and Release Candidate Reporting

At each milestone, each project is expected to send a readout to the
https://lists.opendaylight.org/mailman/listinfo/release[release mailing
list] by 23:59:59 UTC on the date listed for the given milestone and
offset. Most information will be reported via the
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KPpO9LH539Vlcoa4RvLa6PPCdLifi5JD-ihRhlybqeo/edit#gid=1196332566[release
tracking spreadsheet], which can be found in the
link:#Supporting_Documents[supporting documents] section. While most
information will be reported via the spreadsheet, projects should still
send a mail indicating the information has been filled in, reporting any
extra information, and possibly asking additional questions. Reported
information will include things like links to gerrit patches, pointers
to continuous integration Jenkins Jobs, and the like.

Negative statuses should be reported promptly. If a project is under
threat of, or does miss an element on its release plan, the project
contact/lead should report this as soon as it is known. They should not
wait until the next milestone's readout.

It is the responsibility of each project's lead to report both positive
and negative statuses. While they can delegate the task, the project
lead is still ultimately responsible for the project's participation in
the release.

[[simultaneous-release-developer-meetings]]
=== Simultaneous Release Developer Meetings

One week prior to each Milestone or Release Candidate starting at M1, an
IRC meeting for developer interested in the Simultaneous Release will be
organized for real time coordination and check in. The Project for each
project (or their delegate) should minimally be in attendance. This
meeting should happen for each offset at each milestone.

[[bugs]]
=== Bugs

https://bugs.opendaylight.org/[Bugzilla] is used to track all bugs in
OpenDaylight. Bugs must be filed for the appropriate project. General
guidelines and sample searches can be found on the
link:OpenDaylight Bugs[OpenDaylight Bugs] page.

During the release candidate process, all blocking bugs must be both
logged on a bug-tracking spreadsheet (to be provided) and filed
appropriately, e.g., with severity set to BLOCKING, in Buzilla.

[[lessons-from-hydrogen-helium-and-lithium-for-future-releases]]
== Lessons from Hydrogen, Helium and Lithium for future releases

* Service releases should likely continue until some future release
(either one or two releases in the future) rather than after a fixed
number of releases.
** How long after the new release do we wait?
** Do we want to have a specified amount of overlap? 2 weeks? 6 weeks?
* We desperately need pre-made templates for each milestone that make
verifying requirements easy. We just missed things in Lithium M1 to M3
without that.
* We need to mandate source jars generated in a canonical way, i.e., to
be consumed by releng/autorelease.
* We should also mandate javadoc generated in a canonical way, i.e., to
be consumed by releng/autorelease.
* Migration
** Do we want to require data schema translations?
** Other issues?
* The paperwork for M3 was substantial (and not easy see in advance) and
should be streamlined or spread out
** Consolidating all the requirements into one place would likely help.
* We should make sure that people know where to produce and document
known issues. In general, it's three places:
** The release mailing list.
** The Weather page.
** The weekly IRC sync during the last part of the release.
* Make it clear what is expected of projects in terms of tracking what's
going on in ODL.
** Reading the release list.
** Reading tsc list or at least the TSC meeting minutes.
** Attending release IRC meetings or at least reading the minutes.
* Adding a way to deal with docs-like projects that don't provide
code-level negative interactions
** This includes at least docs, toolkit (now mostly defunct), and
coretutorials
** Ideally, they might have laxer requirements
* Deal with cutting branches and version bumps with offsets
** If we cut branches and version bump at the same time, the only issue
we have is slow projects that can hold things up, which has been fixed
by automated version bumping that should happen for Helium.
** However, if we cut branches and version bump at M5, there is an
offset between different projects where upstream projects can merge
patches that break downstream projects causing the version bump for
downstream projects to fail.
** The options seem to be:
1.  cut branches all at the same time, which has the disadvantage that
offset 0 and offset 1 projects have a 4-week and 2-week period after
code freeze where they can't add new features
2.  figure out how to deal with the issue that offset 1 and offset 2
projects may get hit with incompatibilities on version bumps
** Also, cascading tests during staggered branch cutting breaks because
the way JJB is set up right now it's not possible to trigger jobs across
branches even when logically master of an offset 1 project is dependent
on stable/lithium of an offset 0 project.
* Docs improvements
** We'd really like to be able to put project-specific docs in their
repo
*** This should include the ability to directly pull code fragments from
real code
** We'd really like HTML versions of the docs that aren't so fragmented

[[lessons-from-hydrogenhelium-that-should-be-applied]]
== Lessons from Hydrogen/Helium that Should be Applied

Items that are stuck out have been addressed. A comment will follow as
to how it was addressed in blue if it seems like the right approach and
in red if there may still be debate or questions. Similarly, comments in
goldenrod note things that still need to be addressed, but are not
blocking certifying the release plan.

* The Release plan doesn't take into account project dependencies. e.g.
M4 API Freeze. If a project is waiting on API freeze for a project it is
dependent on, then that reduces the amount of time the "dependee" has to
execute. - alagalah (Keith) Done, mainly by moving deadlines up by one
step, e.g., M2 component free, M3 API freeze, M4 code freeze
** We had offsets in Hydrogen, spaced at 2 days. We need 2-3 weeks
between offsets for them to make sense,
** With 6 offsets 2 weeks each we need additional 10 weeks to reach RC0
on all projects,
*** Can we can do it in 3 offsets: +0, +2 weeks, +4 weeks
1.  odlparent, yangtools, and controller
2.  openflowjava, openflowplugin, ovsdb, aaa
3.  everyone else
** Which means lower-offset projects can (and need) to start their
next-release while the SR process is finishing
* We need a Feature Freeze milestone before the API freeze
** It should occur at M3 with beta-quality APIs, so downstream projects
can start consuming Currently at M2 instead, it will be ~M2.5 and ~M3
for most projects
* We're using release@lists.opendaylight.org instead of discuss
* We should make it easy for projects to convey and understand what APIs
they are intending to make available vs. which ones are intended to be
internal attempted as part of component/API freeze
* We should make it clear that participation in Service Releases is not
optional done, see link:#Requirements_for_Participation[#Requirements
for Participation]
* We should make it clear what we expect in terms of timely responses
from project primary contacts for a release done, see
link:#Requirements_for_Participation[#Requirements for Participation]
** This involves identifying what mails that people should pay attention
to, e.g., ones sent to release@lists.opendaylight.org with "PLEASE
RESPOND" in the subject
** It also involves identifying a time frame in which they should
respond, e.g., two business days
*** One concrete stab at making this formal would be: "Technically, two
business days will be defined as 48 hours not counting 2a UTC on Friday
until 2a UTC on Sunday. This corresponds to 48 hours starting at 4p on
Friday in the furthest ahead time zone (UTC+14). Note that this means if
you want a response *this* week, you must send it before 2a UTC on
Wednesday. That’s 6/7p pacific time on Tuesday in the Pacific time
zone." The formal definition is currently left out
* We need a longer time between code freeze and release candidates
because developers don't focus on tests (especially system and
integration tests) until after code freeze
* Status reports for each milestone should include more than a Boolean
for tests
** In general, the templates for status reports should probably be
developed more in advance. TODO: need help developing templates
* We need to make it clear what tasks need to be done for docs, where
and when handled by the deliverable from M2 from docs
** Understanding the kinds of documentation we want to generate and who
the audience is for each kind is going to be critical
*** _e.g., one person's user is likely another's developer_
** The same is true about tests. handled by the deliverable from M2 from
integration
* We really need somebody who groks the things that need to be
accomplished at each milestone and can take a glance at the code and
jenkins jobs for each project to get an idea of whether they're on track
or not. TODO: we still need to make sure we do this for deadlines M3 and
later, e.g., functionality freeze, karaf features defined, API freeze,
and code freeze
* Requirements to meet at different stages (and especially RCs) should
be set and enforced with clearly explained consequences for missing them
ways to fix missed deadlines are now discussed by the TSC for offset
zero and offset one projects as described in
link:#Requirements_for_Participation[requirements for participation]
** Release throttle branch needs to be cut at RC0 at the latest done at
M5 now
* We need a standard way to track blocking issues: TODO: we still need
this, but it's loosely defined in the
link:OpenDaylight_Bugs#Helium_Blocking_Bugs_.28all_projects.29[Helium
blocking bugs section] here.
** One suggestion is to treat them as bugs in bugzilla for easy tracking
and querying
*** Projects would file bugs with severity as "critical", "blocker" with
the target milestone being appropriate
*** Appropriate milestones are sometimes annoying, but generally, it
should be "anything but the next release"
* We need to pre-declare when RCs and final release artifacts will be
cut (both dates and times for clarity) done at M5 and RCs
* Need to add an EOL-plans section to release plan to understand user
impact of EOLed features/components/APIs at the start of a development
cycle done in release plan
** What requirements do we want to place on projects? e.g., deprecated
in one release and can remove in another?
** plans for dealing with EOLed features should be incorporated into the
release plan
* We should reconsider when we set a release date done, there is a month
of slack between the release and the ODL summit and the dates for RCs
after RC0 and the formal release are stated to be tentative based on
testing in the definition of RCs
** Especially to the press, but also in other environments
** For example, do we want to have a booked event giving us effectively
zero wiggle room on the back end?
*** Maybe, because hard deadlines help get things done, but they also
make for sub-optimal
* We could use more automated release processes TODO: yes, but this is
technical debt, not directly related to the release plan
** For example, the auto-release is really, really nice as compared to
spending 14+ hours on IRC cutting everything.
** A similar process for post-release branch cutting and version bumping
would be very helpful, e.g., take a 10+ day process and turn it into one
that takes a few hours.
** One problem is figuring out how to do this w/o requiring involvement
from every project (at least on the critical path).
*** Solutions are (i) allowing for some scripts to commit changes to
projects, which is likely bad, or (ii) automatically pushing patches for
projects to review
*** Another solution is to switch to continuous delivery
* We should avoid scheduling any major events, e.g., a design forum or
summit, immediately after the release so that we can have some room for
slippage without having to pull many developers out of the event into a
"war" room. done. there is a month between the release and the ODL
summit
* More automated features testing TODO: yes, but this is technical debt,
not directly related to the release plan
** to really test things, we need to blow away the m2 repo before
testing every features.xml file
* Cyclic dependencies TODO: yes, but this is technical debt, not
directly related to the release plan
** We need to decide if we want to allow them, and if so what kind to
allow
** We need to provide documentation (or ideally scripts) that show how
to build the code despite the circular dependencies (if we allow them)
** We need tests to check for circular dependencies (either at all or
new ones) so that we know about them
*** The simplest way to do this would be to have an offline auto-release
which first clone all the repos and then tried to build them linearly
without access to the nexus repos.
