[[qualification-test-definition]]
== Qualification test definition

These tests are intended to provide minimal functional tests to ensure
that OpenDaylight can be run successfully on a number of popular
platforms. Testing will adopt the
CrossProject:Integration_Group:Create_System_Test_Environment[ test
procedure] defined by the Integration working group.

Tests will focus on the base edition using default startup configuration
and the basic mininet tests.
