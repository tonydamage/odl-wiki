*Release Readiness email* sent to dev-lists & Project owners +
 +
Hi Devs, +
 +
Sorry about this lengthy email. Please spend a couple of minutes to go
through this. This is EXTREMELY important for the release. +
 +
As discussed during the TSC and the feverish work being done to get to
the Release Readiness, we are tracking all the activities using : +
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoSzir1BfjyWdDQyVElWNG9mcWxhblREckZjbjFxUVE#gid=1 +
 +
This email is to take care of following 2 high priority items under
"Global Code Cleanup" : +
- " Identify all places dependency versions in project pom.xml files are
not current for all ODL Dependencies" +
- " Update dependency versions in all pom.xml files to current SNAPSHOT
version for all ODL Dependencies" +
 +
We have a jenkins job that is running on the controller project :
https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/controller/job/controller-version-changes/configure +
The "versions" plugin in this job will take care most of the work. It
will find the LATEST dependency and also automatically submit a gerrit
changes. +
How cool is that !!! ? : (Example Gerrit submission :
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/4149/) +
 Based on our investigation, we have a simple Action Item for each of
the project owners in each project : +
 +
All you have to do as a project owner is to copy the above jenkins
configuration into your own project and do the necessary modifications
based +
on your project build needs. The most important maven option of interest
: (-B versions:use-latest-versions -DallowSnapshots=true). +
Also observe the execute shell commands which you would need for auto
gerrit review. +
 The goal is to bring down the dependency errors
(https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/integration/job/integration-dependencyConvergence/1/console)
to zero +
and let the integration project build to succeed. +
 +
Thanks, +
Madhu +
 +
 +
For the curious ones - more details : +
 +
I pushed the Dependency-Convergence enforcer changes to integration
branch earlier today : http://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/4189 +
and this identifies all the dependencies that are not converged. +
We also have a jenkins job enabled in the integration project that will
run daily once to keep track of these failures : +
https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/integration/job/integration-dependencyConvergence/ +
 +
Failures seen in the first run : +
https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/integration/job/integration-dependencyConvergence/1/console +
 Please look for "Dependency convergence error" text in the above
console log and this will give the hint on what are the failures that
are currently active +
in each of the bundle. The goal is to bring this to 0 failures. +
