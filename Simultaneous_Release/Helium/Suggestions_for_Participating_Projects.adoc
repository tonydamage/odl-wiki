1.  Track the status of your deliverables
* Add a "status" column to your deliverables in your release plan.
** Making the status a link to the relevant bug is also a really good
way to track things and give a link to more details.
** A good example of both is the
BGP-LS/PCEP:Helium_Release_Plan#Release_Milestones_BGP-LS/PCEP_Release_Milestones[BGP-LS/PCEP:Helium_Release_Plan#Release_Milestones
BGP-LS/PCEP Release Milestones]
* Ideally, we would use a small (small) set of terms with matching
colors/styles, e.g., (feel encouraged to just copy the wikitext)
** "DONE" means what it says
** "DELAYED" means the project missed the deadline, but expects to be
able to recover on its own
*** should include a new expected date/milestone
** "TROUBLE" means the project needs help deliver this, and will likely
miss this deadline
*** should be accompanied by an e-mail to Phil Robb (?) asking for help
so that he can connect you with the right people
** "BLOCKED" means the project can't deliver this because of a
dependency on something outside the project
*** should list the thing being blocked on as concretely as possible,
e.g., a deliverable in another project, ideally with a link to a bug in
bugzilla
** "DROPPED"
*** should be accompanied by a mail to the discuss mailing list
explaining that the the feature is no longer going to be delivered
* We will be creating a spreadsheet to track this across projects,
please update this with the _worst_ status across your deliverables.
2.  Identify the projects you are depending on and start a discussion
with them
* Make sure they understand what you need and are planning on it.
* If you want to be more awesome, list the dependencies with a status
similar to
