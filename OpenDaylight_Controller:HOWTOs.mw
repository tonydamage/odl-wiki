Jolokia is remote JMX with JSON over HTTP. It is fast, simple, polyglot and has unique features. It's JMX on Capsaicin.

The right approach to include Jolokia is to download minimal Jolokia OSGi Agent and run it on the existing Controller's Gemini Web Container. 
Unfortunately, there is a bit of work involved and hence taking the following shortcut.

* Download Jolokia OSGi full bundle from [http://labs.consol.de/maven/repository/org/jolokia/jolokia-osgi-bundle/1.1.3/jolokia-osgi-bundle-1.1.3.jar jolokia-osgi-bundle-1.1.3.jar]
* Copy the jolokia-osgi-bundle-1.1.3.jar into the controller's plugin folder : distribution.opendaylight-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-osgipackage/opendaylight/plugins 
* Add the following configurations at the very end of distribution.opendaylight-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-osgipackage/opendaylight/configuration/config.ini :
:org.jolokia.agentContext=/jolokia
:org.jolokia.debug=true
:org.osgi.service.http.port=9090
* Start the controller
* Open a browser instance and open : http://<controller-ip>:9090/jolokia/list (this will return a gigantic JSON with all the info obtained through JMX).
* Client libraries can be downloaded for Java and Javascript from : http://www.jolokia.org/download.html

NOTE : CORS support must be enabled in a separate jolokia.xml. (Will update more info once I get it working).
