This is a sample load balancer application that balances traffic to backend servers 
based on the source address and source port on each incoming packet.  The service 
reactively installs OpenFlow rules to direct all packets with a specific source address
and source port to one of the appropriate backend servers.  The servers may be chosen 
using a round robin policy or a random policy. This service can be configured via a 
REST APIs which are similar to the OpenStack Quantum LBaaS (Load-balancer-as-a-Service)
v1.0 API proposal (http://wiki.openstack.org/Quantum/LBaaS)

To use this service, a virtual IP (or VIP) should be exposed to the clients of this service
and used as the destination address. A VIP is a entity that comprises of a virtual IP, port
and protocol (TCP or UDP).

Assumptions:
# One or more VIPs may be mapped to the same server pool. All VIPs that share the same pool must also share the same load balancing policy (random or round robin).
# Only one server pool can be be assigned to a VIP.
# All flow rules are installed with an idle timeout of 5 seconds.
# Packets to a VIP must leave the OpenFlow  cluster from the same switch from where it entered it.
# When you delete a VIP or a server pool or a server from a pool, the service does not delete the flow rules it has already installed. The flow rules should automatically time out after the idle timeout of 5 seconds.
