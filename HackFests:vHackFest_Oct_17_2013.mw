== Intro == 

The next vHackFest is focused on Continuous Integration Testing.  All Projects participating in the Hydrogen Simultaneous Release have
committed to getting Continuous Integration Testing going no later than next week.  This vHackFest will bring all of us together to do so.

== When ==

Since OpenDaylight has participants all over the globe, the vHackFest will take place over a 24 hours period, beginning 
Thursday Oct 17, 2013 at 1am PST (10am CEST) and running till Friday Sept 18 at 1am PST (10am CEST).

Participants are not expected to stay up 24 hours, but rather to participate in their own normal work hours.

== Where ==

Coordination over all will happen one the #opendaylight IRC channel on Freenode.

Webexes will be added shortly.

== What ==

As this vHackFest is themed around Continuous Integration Testing, that will be the primary focus (though folks are also welcome to collaborate on other things as well).

=== How to ===
The key things we need to accomplish for the Continuous Integration Testing vHackFest are, for each project participating in the Hydrogen Release:

# Integration with the ODL Neutron Service
# Integration with the MD-SAL
