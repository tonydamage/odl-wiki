=Introduction=
Key distribution in a scaled network has always been a challenge, as part of the SNBI project we intend to simplify the process of bootstrapping network devices with the keys required for secure communication. SNBI enables not only boot strapping devices with the required keys, but enables connectivity to the network devices by assigning unique IPv6 addresses. Admission control of devices into a specific domain is achieved using the combination of Black/white list of authorized devices and the device IEEE802.1 AR certificates.
