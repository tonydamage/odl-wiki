=Introduction=
Key distribution in a scaled network has always been a challenge, as part of the SNBI project we intend to simplify the process of bootstrapping network devices with the keys required for secure communication. SNBI enables not only boot strapping devices with the required keys, but enables connectivity to the network devices by assigning unique IPv6 addresses. Admission control of devices into a specific domain is achieved using the combination of Black/white list of authorized devices and the device IEEE802.1 AR certificates.

=Architecture and Design=
The diagram below represents the various modules involved. The description of each of the module will be done below.

=== SNBI South Plugin ===
The SNBI south plugin involves the following set of modules.
* '''SNBI Sockets:''' SNBI uses application layer sockets to sends and receive packets. SNBI operates on top of UDP port 8888, and appends an SNBI header to all the packets that are sent out on the socket. The SNBI header is used to identify the type of message being exchanged.

:'''''Version:'''''  A 4 bit version indicates SNBI protocol version.
:'''''reserved:''''' A 4 bit reserved field, it is not used currently.
:'''''protocol type:''''' A 8 bit protocol type field, the protocol type identifies what type of protocol information is being exchanged. Examples of protocol types are Adjacency Discovery, Bootstrap etc.
:'''''Flags:''''' A 8 bit flags field, this is reserved and is not being used.
:'''''Message type:''''' A 16 bit message type field. The field identifies the message type for each protocol type. The various message types for each protocol type will be described further below.

* '''Neighbour Discovery:''' The first step towards accommodating devices into a secure network is Neighbour Discovery. SNBI performs neighbour discovery by periodically transmitting to a multicast IPv6 address.
