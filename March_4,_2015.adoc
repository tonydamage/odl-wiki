Attendees: Basheer, Mohnish, YuLing.

* Basheer shared the progress on Default Data Store POC implementation
and the goal is to complete it and check in early next week.
* Basheer shared the Karaf feature implementation/progress, and
mentioned that we need to finalize the feature structure ASAP and the
target is to check in the Karaf feature implementation early next week.
* Basheer mentioned that we will need to figure out the sequence for
each component to merge into the main.

YuLing is going to show a demo for demonstrating the Data Storage
implementation in the next meeting, which will facilitate the code
review of the Data Storage.

* YuLing shared the status and progress on Data Storage and Persistence
Service. The major remaining tasks are
** Completing all types of OpenFlow statistics for data storage.
** Add Unit Test cases for Data Storage and persistence.
** Dynamically creating HBase schema during Data Storage service
initialization.
* For Data Collection, there were two major tasks/issues that we need to
complete/resolve from what left out from the POC:
* Retrieving various object keys from the OpenFlow Statistics data
structure, such as NodeID, FlowTableID, and FlowID.
* Resolve the issue that we could not receive OpenFlow Statistics data
periodically from OpenFlow Plugin through notification. Sharon, although
you were not in the meeting, we discussed about these two issues/work
items. Just wondering if you have followed up on these two issues and is
there any update?
* YuLing mentioned that Persistence Project is actively working on
sample application for supporting TSDR. We could consider more closely
working with Persistence Project after M3 to leverage the collaboration.
Of course, the priority would still be the deliverables in Lithium time
frame.
