# '''DEPENDENCY-INTEGRATION-TEST''': Have a test in the integration project that fails whenever the contents of the plugin or lib directory for a Release Vehicle acquires a new bundle that is not from org.opendaylight.
This failure would precipitate a polite question to the project causing it as to whether they were aware of they had introduce a new dependency and whether they had given thought to
whether it was necessary.

The same mechanism could be used to look for duplicates of dependency versions in an attempt to encourage unintentional proliferation of dependency versions (two different versions of the same depencency).
