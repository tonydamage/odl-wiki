= VTN API =
The VTN API module is a sub component of the VTN coordinator and provides the north bound REST API interface for VTN applications
It consists of two subcomponents
:*Web Server
:*VTN Service Java API library

== Web Server ==
The Web Server module handles the REST APIs received from the VTN applications. 
It translates the REST APIs to the appropriate Java APIs.

The main functions of this module are
:*Is started via the startup script catalina.sh.
:*VTN Application sends HTTP request to Web server in XML or JSON format.
:*Creates a session and acquire a read/write lock.
:*Invokes the VTN Service Java API corresponding to the specified URI.
:*Returns the response to the VTN Application.

== VTN Service ==
The VTN Service provides the Java API library to communicate with the lower layer modules in the VTN Coordinator.

The main functions of this library are
:*Creates an IPC client session to the lower layer.
:*Converts the request to IPC framework format.
:*Invokes the lower layer API (i.e. UPLL API, UPPL API, TC API).
:*Return the response from the lower layer to the web server
