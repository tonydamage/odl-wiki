PCEP tunel programming poses an interesting challenge when dealing with
the underlying network. The Controller sits as a mediator between two
asynchronous systems: the network and the application controlling it.
The application effectively measures the state of the network, decides
how it wants to transform the network and then pushes instructions to
effect that transformation... except the network lives in the real world
and in the real world Things Fail. Which means we get state
synchronization conflicts which need to be solved when they occur, while
keeping the conflict-free operation fast.

The ODL implementation of PCEP LSP signalling proposes a solution to
this problem which works by recognizing that the time lag between the
application and the network actually means that the application works on
what it thinks the network will look like -- effectively simulating
reality. As long as that simulation is 'close enough' the application
and the network works.
