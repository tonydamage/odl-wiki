=== Lab Access ===

Lab access is provided through SSH server with public key authentication. Please follow the steps bellow:
* Generate a public key in the SSH client and mail it to christopher.o.shea@ericsson.com along with your username.
* Once the key gets provisioned in the SSH server, do: '''ssh username@server2.verkstad.net (129.192.170.80)'''. In case of authentication problems please contact christopher.o.shea@ericsson.com
* The SSH server allows SSH forwarding (SSH tunnels) so you can configure a many as you need (example to forward VNC: ssh -L 15900:10.125.136.37:5900 alias@server2.verkstad.net)
