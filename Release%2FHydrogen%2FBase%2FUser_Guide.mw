|-
| Container Manager || Manages Network Slicing
|-
| Switch Manager || Handles SB devices Information
|-
| Statistics Manager || Collects Statistics information
|-
| Topology Manager || Builds network topology
|-
| Host Tracker || Tracks about connected hosts
|-
| Forwarding Rules Manager || Installs Flows on SB devices
|-
| ARP Handler || Handles ARP messages
|-
| Forwarding Manager || Installs Routes and tracks next-hop
|-

===Installation Guide (link)===
The installation instructions for the Base Edition can be found [https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Release/Hydrogen/Base/Installation_Guide here].

===Installation Troubleshooting (link)===
A list of troubleshooting steps for installation can be found [https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Controller:Installation here] under the Troubleshooting section.

===Configuration===
* In order to configure OpenDaylight Base edition using OpenFlow 1.3 plugin, start Opendaylight Controller with ''-of13'' option. Otherwise, it will use the OpenFlow 1.0. 

* To start mininet for OF13 simulation for example do: ''mininet> sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=a.b.c.d --topo tree,2 --switch ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow13'' 

* To start mininet for OF10 simulation for example do:  ''mininet> sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=10.125.136.52 --topo tree,2''

===Tutorial / How-To===
Step-by-step instructions for doing some basic functionality with this edition

===Web / Graphical Interface===

# After login using the credentials (by default user=admin/password=admin) the first page you will see looks like the following:

[[Image:login.png|951px]]


# You can add gateway by clicking on the button "Add Gateway IP Address" on the buttom-middle of the page:

[[Image:gateway.png|951px]]

# You can also add flow entries by clicking on the butoon "Add Flow Entry" on the top-left of the page:

[[Image:flow.png|951px]]

# In order to add a flow entry, it has to be determined in which node (switch) the flow is going to be added as well as the action to be taken on that flow. These are the minimum requirements to install a flow in a node. There are other parameters for the flow, which can be find [http://openvswitch.org/cgi-bin/ovsman.cgi?page=utilities%2Fovs-ofctl.8 here] under the Flow Syntax.

===Command Line Interface===
If applicable, descriptions of command line interfaces and common parameters / switches

===Console Interface===
If applicable, descriptions of menus and choices in a console interface

===Programmatic Interface(s) (link)===
The starting point for developers is [https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/GettingStarted:Developer_Main here], which provides information on pulling, hacking, and pushing the code from CLI. The OpenDaylight Controller allows developers to observe and manage the controller via web applications. A programmer guide can be found [https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Controller:Programmer_Guide here].

===Release Notes (link)===
The release notes for the Base Edition can be found [https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Release/Hydrogen/Base/Release_Notes here].
