== Description  ==
BGP/PCEP protocol library is a project aiming to provide Java-based implementation of [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4271 Border Gateway Protocol] and [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5440 Path Computation Element Protocol].


By enabling the the Controller to utilize more standardized ways of talking to the underlying network, it can be deployed in a wider variety of scenarios.


BGP is the core protocol holding together the Internet in its current shape and form, which is extensible enough to provide functions well outside of its original purpose. With the advent of [https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-idr-ls-distribution-03 Link State and TE Information draft], BGP can be used to safely distribute IGP information to entities outside of usual IGP peering. The Controller is a prime example of a network entity which can benefit from this information, as it can directly use it as a source of topology information.


PCEP is a protocol originally designed for offloading optimal path computation in MPLS-TE networks from the head-end router to a dedicated accelerator (called Path Computation Element, or PCE) residing on the control plane. While the original specification called for a router-driven operation, the recently adopted [https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-pce-stateful-pce-04 Stateful PCE extension] aligns the protocol for use by the Controller.
