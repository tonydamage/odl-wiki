[[externally-consumable-apis]]
== Externally Consumable APIs

* Please list and describe all externally consumable APIs or point to a
document that does so.
* This need not be a list of all java interfaces and yang files, but
should be a list of high-level functionality, e.g., flow programming.
** For each such API, there should be a list of the bundles providing
the API, but not necessarily the implementation.
* Each PROVISIONAL or TENTATIVE API must be listed as project
deliverable
** Must be declared as "IN" or "OUT" at the M3 Milestone

== Expected Incompatibilities with Other Projects

== Compatibility with Previous Releases

[[removed-apis-andor-functionality]]
=== Removed APIs and/or Functionality

* N/A

[[deprecated-apis-andor-functionality]]
=== Deprecated APIs and/or Functionality

[[changed-apis-andor-functionality]]
=== Changed APIs and/or Functionality

* Please include list of a APIs and/or functionality that existed the
previous release and will be changed.
** For each such API/functionality, provide guidance about who will be
affected and how they should adapt.
** In general, project's should strive to be backward compatible with
the previous release and note what functionality will be removed by
deprecating it and noting that with the `@Deprecated` annotations
wherever possible.

[[themes-and-priorities]]
== Themes and Priorities

[[requests-from-other-projects]]
== Requests from Other Projects

For each API request, the requesting project should create an entry like
the example below. After creating the entry, the requesting project
should send an e-mail to release@lists.opendaylight.org, and both
projects' dev lists using this template:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [REQUEST FOR NEW OR EXTENDED API] ${API name}

Note: This email is a request from ${requesting project} for a new or
extended API in ${providing project}.

API Name: ${API name}
Request: ${link to the request in the providing project's release plan}

Please let us know if you will be able to provide this new
functionality by the listed milestone. If you need clarifications or
help in providing the API, let us know so we can reach an agreement.

If you feel that providing this API is a bad idea regardless of where
the resources are coming from, please let us know why and ideally,
suggest and alternative.
