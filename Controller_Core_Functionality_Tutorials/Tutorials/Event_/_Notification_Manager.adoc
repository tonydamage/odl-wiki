= Overview of Event Topic Broker

[[introduction]]
== Introduction

Today it is common to have plethora of data collection platforms, often
dedicated to specific devices. These platforms often act as inadvertent
silos for the data they obtain, which can be inefficient when looking at
Big Data approach to OSS/management/service creation.

Naturally different devices have individual requirements when it comes
to 'big-data' collection. The OpenDaylight southbound architecture
provides us with an excellent framework for device interaction, not only
to configure devices/system, but also to function as an acquisition
layer for management/telemetry data.

Different OSS, EMS, Analytics and other platforms have particular
requirements when it comes to ingesting data. The OpenDaylight
northbound architecture can therefore be utilised to provide support for
a variety of data connector plugins.

Security and policy control of network data has always been a complex
issue for network/infrastructure providers, and data is often collected
by multiple times by multiple systems. Using a centralised approach, the
controller can be programmed through policy to ‘collect once, distribute
many’.

In summary Open Daylight lends itself well to being both a controller
environment for not only configuration / management, but also as a
conduit between devices and OSS.

[[how-can-i-try-this]]
== How can I try this?

The core code and an example event generator / user-agent is available
via:

---------------------------------------------------------------
git clone https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/coretutorials.git
---------------------------------------------------------------

Section 2 of this wiki details how to build, configure and use some
example REST APIs.

[[key-components]]
== Key Components

In order to enable both the sending and receiving of notifications via a
Topic system there are 3 key component areas which enable this
functionality.We can best describe the new functionality by In order to
implement this functionality OpenDaylight gains the following new
functions:

[[event-topic-broker-evtb]]
=== Event Topic Broker (EvTB)

A set of APIs which enabled Opendaylight to encapsulate
events/notifications and present them as Topics which can be subscribed
to. You can identify this function in OpenDaylight as a features called
'odl-message-bus' *** name to be changed shortly ***

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
odl-message-bus                 | 1.2.0-SNAPSHOT  |  x         odl-controller-1.2.0-SNAPSHOT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[spi-southbound-convenience-api]]
=== SPI (southbound convenience API)

Provides an SPI to enable a plugin to register with the EvTB as an Event
Source.

[[user-agents-ua]]
=== User Agents (UA)

These are effectively plugins which subscribed to one or more Topic/s.
They can be self-contained, for example an Application which ingests and
acts on notifications, or they can be connectors to other platforms or
applications, for example an XMPP client connected to an external Jabber
based infrastructure. The function of a User Agent can also be
implemented into a Southbound plugin, should this be so desired.

[[event-topic-broker-evtb-1]]
== Event Topic Broker (EvTB)

[[core-capabilities]]
=== Core Capabilities

[[event-sources-evs]]
==== Event Sources (EvS)

An event source is a physical or virtual object that is capable of
producing notifications. Examples of Event Sources would be, network
devices such as Routers/Switches, newly emerging devices from IOT
platforms, virtual appliances from NFV. etc. It is also possible of the
EvS to be a Southbound plugin, which is either proxying for the
nodes/devices which is manages, or simply that the plugin is an eEvS.

[[topics]]
==== Topics

A Topic is a stream of notifications/events produced from a user defined
set of nodes and notification type. Two patterns have to be used when
creating a topic: the event source nodes are specified by
'node-id-pattern', the notification types by 'notification-pattern'. For
example "node-id-pattern":"router_PE_*" and "notification-pattern":
"urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-syslog*". When a topic is created a
identified by a unique ID is returned, for example 563ac588

[[event-source-topology-evst]]
==== Event Source Topology (EvST)

Nodes which register as being Event Source capable are stored in the
Event Source Topology (EvST). This is effectively a data-base residing
in the OpenDaylight data-store and is used by the Event Manager to
identify nodes and their capabilities.

[[interfaces-provided]]
=== Interfaces Provided

Topic management is via a set of APIs, which enable the creation /
deletion of Topics, and give the ability to subscribe to Topics.

[[topic-management-via-rest-creating-and-destroying-a-topic]]
== Topic Management via REST (Creating and Destroying a Topic)

For creating and destroying a topic the suitable equivalents of the REST
API requests stated in the examples below can be used.

[[creating-a-topic]]
=== Creating a Topic

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
POST http://localhost:8181/restconf/operations/event-aggregator:create-topic
HEADERS Content-Type application/json

{ "event-aggregator:input": {
  "notification-pattern": "pattern.of.notification.*",
  "node-id-pattern":"router-17*" 
  }
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The request returns a topic-id unique to that particular topic., for
example:

----------------------------------------------------------
{
    "output": {
        "topic-id": "9f4e18cd-06f0-4ad6-9d16-ad9a34eb4031"
    }
}
----------------------------------------------------------

[[destroying-a-topic]]
=== Destroying a Topic

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
POST http://localhost:8181/restconf/operations/event-aggregator:destroy-topic
HEADERS Content-Type application/json

<destroy-topic>
  <topic-id>9f4e18cd-06f0-4ad6-9d16-ad9a34eb4031</topic-id>
</destroy-topic>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The request returns no value....** to be updated **

[[topic-management-via-java-api]]
== Topic Management via JAVA API

[[creating-and-destroying-a-topic]]
=== Creating and Destroying a Topic

To create or destroy a topic, a client code has to gain a particular
EventAggregatorService via the RpcProviderRegistry and to call the
appropriate methods of the service:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Future<RpcResult<CreateTopicOutput>> createTopic(CreateTopicInput input)

Future<RpcResult<java.lang.Void>> destroyTopic(DestroyTopicInput input);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[example-event-generator---hweventsource]]
== Example Event Generator - hweventsource

Available for the OpenDaylight controller is a set of features which
allow a user/developer to test the basic functionality of the Event
Topic Broker.

The hweventsource project can be considered a starting point for
users/developers wishing to understand how to generate events, create a
topic and then subscribe to that topic.

The hweventsource application creates its own event source and register
instances of this Event Source (nodes) to the MD SAL infrastructure
using the Event Topic Broker. The registration of Event Source nodes has
to be done via the EventSourceRegistry, which is a part of the Event
Topic Broker SPI. Each event source node periodically simulates
occurring of an event by generating appropriate notifications. The
EventSourceRegistry notifies the registered event source nodes about new
topics.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[trying-out-the-functionality]]
= Trying out the Functionality

The CoreTutorials project includes all the functionality mentioned in
part 1 of this Wiki.

[[building-the-project]]
== Building the Project

In your project build directory clone the coretutorials project and
build it. If you wish to run all the test, then remove
'-Dcheckstyle.skip=true -DskipTests=true' from the instructions below,
however it will take significantly longer to build.

---------------------------------------------------------------
git clone https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/coretutorials.git
cd coretutorials
mvn clean install -Dcheckstyle.skip=true -DskipTests=true
---------------------------------------------------------------

Start OpenDaylight and check out the build.

-------------------------------------------
cd /hweventsource/karaf/target/assembly/bin
./karaf
-------------------------------------------

Setup an event-output file, which will be used view the subscribed
events later.

----------------------------
mkdir  -p /var/tmp/test-logs
chmod 777 /var/tmp/test-logs
----------------------------

[[exploring-the-functionality]]
== Exploring the Functionality

By default the _odl-message-bus_ and _hweventsource_ are loaded and
therefore you can view entries in the _Event Source Topology_.

[[view-event-source-topology]]
=== View Event Source Topology

The REST call to view this is below:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GET http://localhost:8181/restconf/operational/network-topology:network-topology

HEADERS Content-Type application/json
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

you will be returned a result of:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{
    "network-topology": {
        "topology": [
            {
                "topology-id": "EVENT-SOURCE-TOPOLOGY",
                "topology-types": {
                    "event-source:topology-event-source": {}
                },
                "node": [
                    {
                        "node-id": "EventSourceSample01",
                        "event-source:event-source-node": "EventSourceSample01"
                    },
                    {
                        "node-id": "EventSourceSample00",
                        "event-source:event-source-node": "EventSourceSample00"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[creating-a-topic-1]]
=== Creating a Topic

In order to create a Topic you will need to create a topic. In this
example we use the notification-pattern that corresponds a given
notification type and to the desired nodes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
POST: http://localhost:8181/restconf/operations/event-aggregator:create-topic
HEADERS: Content-Type application/json
BODY:
{ "event-aggregator:input": {
  "notification-pattern": "*sample*",
  "node-id-pattern":"*00"  
  }
}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will be returned a response via REST contining the unique Topic-ID.

----------------------------------------------------------
{
    "output": {
        "topic-id": "c61d441c-ac01-4f23-983f-cc53cf0d0cd7"
    }
}
----------------------------------------------------------

[[subscribing-to-the-topic]]
=== Subscribing to the Topic

As described in section 1.8 included in the project is a basic
user-agent called _odl-hweventsource-uagent_. This UA can subscribe to
the topic you have just created and output this to a log file for the
purposes of demonstration.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
POST: http://localhost:8181/restconf/operations/uagent-topic-read:read-topic
HEADERS: Content-Type application/json
BODY:
{  
  "input":  
  {      "uagent-topic-read:topic-id": "c61d441c-ac01-4f23-983f-cc53cf0d0cd7"
  }
}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[viewing-the-topic-events]]
=== Viewing the Topic Events

Earlier you created a directory, and it is here we can use the log file
to view the events coming from the subscription to the Topic. In a
terminal window you can simply 'tail the log file.

------------------------------------------------------
tail -f /var/tmp/test-logs/hweventsource-uagent-00.log
------------------------------------------------------

You will see a new 'Event' in the log every 3 seconds.

[[playing-with-event-paramaters-in-hweventsource]]
=== Playing with Event Paramaters in _hweventsource_

There are 2 configuration files which control the _hweventsource_
functions. Since this is only a demo to generate events, the config is
limited. However if you wish to play around you the following parameters
can be configured.

In your project direction move to the following directory

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
cd /coretutorials/hweventsource/karaf/target/assembly/etc/opendaylight/karaf
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here you will see the following 2 files:

01-hweventsource-config.xml and 02-hweventsource-config-uagent.xml

[[changing-the-event-parameters]]
==== Changing the Event Parameters

In _01-hweventsource-config.xml_ you can set the following parameters:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<number-event-sources>2</number-event-sources> <!-- number of event sources created after start  -->
<message-generate-period>3</message-generate-period> <!-- each event source will generate notification in given period (in seconds)    -->
<message-text>Hello World</message-text> <!-- notification will contain given text -->
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In _02-hweventsource-config-uagent.xml_ you can change the output
directory of the events.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<output-file-name>/var/tmp/test-logs/hweventsource-uagent-00.log</output-file-name>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[work-in-progress-will-be-a-split-from-this-wiki---registering-a-plugin-as-an-event-source-work-in-progress]]
= *** WORK IN PROGRESS *** Will be a split from this Wiki - Registering
a plugin as an Event Source *** WORK IN PROGRESS ***

To register and unregister as an Event Source a client/plugin has to use
the _EventSourceRegistry_ service. This service is provided by the
_messagebus-app-impl_ module.

The items of the arguments passed to these methods are equivalent to
those used in REST API requests.

An event source is a topology node able to produce notifications. To
register an event source, the client code has to perform the next steps:

Create an object of the class implementing the EventSource interface.
The getSourceNodeKey() method of this class has to return NodeKey
identifying the topology node that is event source.

To register EventSource object, the client has to call method
registerEventSource() on the EventSourceRegistry service. The service
will add node into the event source topology and register it as RPC
provider. The registerEventSource() method returns an
EventSourceRegistration object.

The registered event source will be associated with all topics known at
the time of it’s registration and with all topics created later.
Unregistering an Event Source

To unregister an event source the client code has to call the method
close() on the EventSourceRegistration object. The EventSourceRegistry
removes the node from the event source topology and unregisters it as
RPC provider.
