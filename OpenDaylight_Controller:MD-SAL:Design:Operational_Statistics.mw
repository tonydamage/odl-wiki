::* Read-Only (counts)
::* Read-Write (counts)
::* Write-Only (counts)
:* Successful transactions  (counts)
:* Failed transactions  (counts)

* RPCs
:* RPC sent  (counts)

=== Implementation ====
Probably using https://github.com/twitter/jsr166e/blob/master/src/main/java/com/twitter/jsr166e/LongAdder.java instead of AtomicLong, which should have better performance for increments,
performance penalty is for reading statistics.
