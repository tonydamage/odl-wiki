NOTE: This is a collection of ideas as a starting point and is not a
consensus as to actual best practices in the community. Some of the
ideas here may be wonderful and some may be terrible. Consider it a
starting point for discussion.

_NOTE:_ These are copied from a
https://pad.opendaylight.org/public/DevelopmentBestPractices[previous
etherpad document] which tried to aggregate best practices. It was
originally authored by:

* David Bainbridge (dbainbri@ciena.com)
* Alon Harel (Mellanox)
* Alissa Bonas (Red Hat)
* Mike Outland (mike.outland@nexusis.com)

3 goals

1.  express my specific ideas of developer best practices
2.  refine based on community input
3.  not stand in the way of computer history (read: beer)

community and collaboration

* GettingStarted:Code_of_Conduct[Code of Conduct]
* be considerate, respectful, and collaborative
* community building is core to success

meritocracy

* a flat organizational structure that values contributions based on

merit rather than status, position, etc.

passion

* see community and collaboration

what are we trying to do?

* write software to solve problems
* write mainatainable software to solve users' problems
* build a community to write and maintain software that solves problems
users care about

socialize ideas

* email, irc
* private communication does not foster community building
* conversation on ephemeral media should be summarized to a relevant
list
* draft review (publish early and often)
* private?
* should we adopt a feature page or blueprint mechanism?

Action Items

* ACTION: email lists transition to topics
* ACTION: deprecate/remove per-project -announce,-devel, -users
* ACTION: draft reviews are private?
* ACTION: feature branches
* ACTION: propose feature page/blueprint
* ACTION: TSC steering architecture * need TSC to guide key architecture
directions to maintain project viability, wild west can lead to project
fractures and divergence.

patch submission

* what are we trying to do?
* your job is to minimize patch reviewer's effort
* bring the reviewer into your patch
* Open Source Project's Paradox
* developer resources appear infinite
* review resources are decidedly finite
* reviewers are chronically overloaded and under appreciated

* DO break patches into self-contained logical pieces
* there is nothing wrong with a series of patches
* "do one thing and do it well"
* rule of thumb smaller is better
* easier to review
* easier to bisect
* easier to revert if it was later discovered to be wrong
* as small as possible, no smaller. iow, don't unnecesarily break patch
down
* do NOT mix together unrelated changes
* whitespaces, different functionality
* do NOT send huge patches...they are too hard to review

* commit messages matter
* short, meaningful one line summary ( see
http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html ) (
http://xkcd.com/1296/ )
* followed by clear description of what is being done and why
* refer to bug# but don't rely on details of bug as only description
* can the bug summary be pulled into the commit comment automatically?
* a reviewer is likely not to have your context, nothing wrong with a
complete explanation
* a reviewer needs to know what you intended to do compared w/ what your
code actually does
* a reviewer needs to know what considerations you made when creating
the patch
* there is a very good chance a developer will read this commit well
after it was added to the tree

patch review

* reviewer's job
* read code, understand changes, clearly articulate why it should or
shouldn't be merged
* +1 and -1 are fine to use (0 is really commentary)
* constructively criticize code or ideas not people
* submitter's job
* respond to reviewers
* it's ok to agree to disagree, but be clear

patch merge

* do not merge your own patches
* two committers review
* consider some time for others to review before you merge
* increase number of committers (more actively add committers)

unit testing

* rarely enough, test what code should do (+ve and -ve cases)
* code coverage stats

documentation

* APIs should be documented, projects should share tools for generating
documentation
* can we manage this by a bot that verifies documentation as a blocker
for check in

project structure

* root pom.xml is currently just about anywhere
* inconsistent distribution vs. root of project vs...
* coding style consistency
* verify/build
* fewer maven projects

maven build

* inconsistent use of parent/child
* inconsistent dependencies
* how about a common opendaylight.common?
* how about a single version per project?
* simpler version management
* xtend -> java -> debugging is very difficult

technical debt is real

* code in the tree is substantially less likely to get fixed
later...leverage is at code review time
* "just because it's easier" is almost always wrong
* refactor, add abstractions, and do it right the first time
* garbage collection, need to deprecate and remove code branches that
were abandoned or have been replaced with something newer

automate

* _and_ put it in git
