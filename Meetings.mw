== Overview ==

This page contains a summary of the OpenDaylight meetings. Some are for projects, others are for committees.

Meetings are typically be held via a combination of these tools:
* IRC, either Freenode/#opendaylight-meeting or a project-specific channel
* Google Hangouts
* Webex

== Other Resources ==

=== Project-specific wikis ===

Many projects maintain their on wikis for their meeting info. They typically contain information about the meeting time, how to connect and a log of meeting minutes. Those wikis should be considred more authoritative than this aggregate wiki. If you're having problems with a Webex link, check the project's meeting wiki and/or their IRC channel for an updated one.

=== Google Calendar ===

The information on this page is aggregated in a Google Calendar, which some people may find to be a more consumable format. Here's a [http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=aDc5aGltYm9rcThhYXVyOWxlZDhvYzc5MGdAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ direct link], here's an [https://www.google.com/calendar/ical/h79himbokq8aaur9led8oc790g%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics iCal-format link] and here's an [https://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/h79himbokq8aaur9led8oc790g%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic XML-format link]. Following the direct link, then clicking on the small button at the bottom right corner of the page seems to be a method that works for most people. This wiki, and by extension the project-specific wikis, should be considered more authoritative than the Google Calendar.

If there's an error with the Google Calendar, please contact Daniel Farrell (dfarrell07 on Freenode/#opendaylight, dfarrell@redhat.com).

== Time Representation Explanation ==
For better or worse, many meeting times are pegged to a given time in a given location. This implies that the meeting time in UTC will change when that base location transitions between Daylight and Savings time. Currently, all such meetings are pegged to the US, which is currently in Standard Time and will be until November 2nd 2014. '''If you're reading this before that date, use the Standard Time UTC value, else use the Daylight Time value and update this wiki'''. For example, Bonnie in the Western US will always see 10AM on her phone when the TSC meeting starts, but Clyde in Eastern China will need to add 8 to the UTC time appropriate for the current date.

In general, to translate a UTC meeting time into your local time issue the `timedatectrl status` command in a Linux shell, then add/subtract the timezone offset it gives you from the appropriate Daylight/Standard UTC meeting time to derive the meeting time in your location's notation.

Note that UTC is always written in 24-hour format, and that this wiki expresses all times in 24-hour format.
