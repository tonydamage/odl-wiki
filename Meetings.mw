== Overview ==

This page contains a summary of the OpenDaylight meetings. Some are for projects, others are for committees.

Meetings are typically be held via a combination of these tools:
* IRC, either '''#opendaylight-meeting''' or a project-specific channel
* Google Hangouts
* Webex

== Other Resources ==

=== Project-specific wikis ===

Many projects maintain their on wikis for their meeting info. They typically contain information about the meeting time, how to connect and a log of meeting minutes. Those wikis should be considred more authoritative than this aggregate wiki. If you're having problems with a Webex link, check the project's meeting wiki and/or their IRC channel for an updated one.

=== Google Calendar ===

The information on this page is aggregated in a Google Calendar, which some people may find to be a more consumable format. Here's a [http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=aDc5aGltYm9rcThhYXVyOWxlZDhvYzc5MGdAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ direct link], here's an [https://www.google.com/calendar/ical/h79himbokq8aaur9led8oc790g%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics iCal-format link] and here's an [https://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/h79himbokq8aaur9led8oc790g%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic XML-format link]. Following the direct link, then clicking on the small button at the bottom right corner of the page seems to be a method that works for most people. This wiki, and by extension the project-specific wikis, should be considered more authoritative than the Google Calendar.

If there's an error with the Google Calendar, please contact Daniel Farrell (dfarrell07 on IRC, dfarrell@redhat.com).
