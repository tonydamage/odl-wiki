Welcome to the ODL-SDNi project page!

[[introduction]]
== Introduction

The OpenDaylight- SDN Interface Application project aims at enabling
inter-SDN controller communication by developing SDNi (Software Defined
Networking interface) as an application(ODL-SDNi App). The SDN
application is deployable on OpenDaylight-Helium.

[[getting-started-with-odl-sdni]]
== Getting Started with ODL-SDNi

We are still in development and have needs from developers to network
guys or anywhere in between. All contributions from upstream code to
docs and tutorials. Tutorials and getting started links will be added
shortly.

== Example Usage

ODL-SDNi App can be used for Bandwidth on demand across inter-SDN
Federated Controllers

* In the multi-vendor environment, network traffic would need to be
orchestrated across intra-/inter-domain subnets of the SDN controllers.
* The mandate is of a east-west communication that enables SDN
controllers across subnets to exchange network information within the
purview of defined policies
* Inter-SDN controller (multi-vendor) communication â€“ exchange of
network parameters needs to be per pre-agree interface specifications

[[issues]]
== Issues

1.  The ODL-SDNi App needs an SDNiWrapper which will have a BGP protocol
implemented.The plan is to use the current BGP library being developed
for an end to end session between multiple controllers.
2.  Using this library to establish a session is being investigated
upon.
3.  Modification needs to be done on top of this library for data
exchange.
4.  End to End Testing will be on hold as long as the BGP session
establsihment is not figured out.
