This is a scratch page for future features and to do items.

To Do/Discuss Features:

[[in-progress-or-completed]]
== In Progress or Completed

* Delete Mappings: design and implement and NB API to delete mapping
feature per EID prefix. Options: default to overwrite with inclusion of
merge bit to add instead of overwrite, or use TTL = 0 to delete.
** So far, default to overwrite is enabled. Merge bit is not
implemented.
* SMR: Options: Feature and NB API to SMR a particular network (EID
prefix) with new mappings of a specific EID,
** Completed. add mapping from NB API will send an SMR to all subscribed
xTRs for the associated prefix, only if there is a change in the
mapping.

[[not-started]]
== Not Started

* Enable integration of LISP SB plugin with GUI and node database
* Associate key with Instance ID as well as EID
* Differentiate mappings installed from NB vs SB: The delete feature
with merge bit may be able to handle this case as well
* Store flows: This requires design or adoption of a flow LCAF

[[odl-developer-forum-notes]]
== ODL Developer Forum Notes

* Discuss using odlparent for dependency versioning (In progress)
** We now have our own parent defining the version of many components
** We should inherit those version from the odlparent to avoid potential
conflicts or hard to debug problems
* [line-through]*Checkstyle*
** Still need to clean up existing code to conform to checkstyle, and
turn on enforce
* Keep both NB configured mappings and SB registered mappings in the
DAO, under separate subkeys
** That means we split the current "address" subkey into "northbound"
and "southbound"
** Useful for timer expiration of SB originated mappings ONLY
** *Useful for supporting ELP in the mapping system for data plane
elements not supporting ELP on their own*
*** '''If we have an ELP from the NB, we do source based map-replies and
include the full ELP with higher prio, and the next hop with lower prio
for nodes not understanding ELP
*** Configure the source of the Map-Request on the router
** The DAO needs to be well documented in the Developer Guide
* Migrate to RESTCONF & YANG & config subsystem
** NB configuration through RESTCONF and pushed to config subsystem
** We still keep the ClusterDAO in-memory data structure for the mapping
system
* Deprecate and remove old AD-SAL based REST API, and Java based LISP
data model'''
* Use DLUX
* LISP device YANG model
** We want something that can be standardized in the IETF
** Should be for an xTR base config
** Allows augmentation for platform specific configs
* NETCONF on LISPmob
* Look into Dlux YANG GUI tab for NETCONF
* SFC renderer to translate SFC service chain to ELP mapping
* Create a Vagrantfile to make it easy creating the tutorial testbed
* Karaf CLI support
* It should be possible to set the variables in the
config.ini/custom.properties files at runtime, both from the CLI, and
from RESTCONF
* Add a tutorial which uses the MD-SAL/RESTCONF way of doing things
(keep the old one too?)
* Keep an eye on the Discovery project for unified topology view
* Use Packet-Ins from OVS punting as "Map-Requests" to install "mapping"
flows in OVS
* Neutron: add Host IP to the API and store that somewhere in LISP (or
MD-SAL datastore)
* Neutron create port integration
*
