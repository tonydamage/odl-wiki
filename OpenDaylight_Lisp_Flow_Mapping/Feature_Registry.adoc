This page contains a registry of features supported in the develop
branch of lispflowmapping project as they are added, organized by the
releases that they were added in.

[[feature-registry]]
== Feature Registry

[[hydrogen-release]]
=== Hydrogen Release

* LISP Map Server with flat key-value mappings
* Support for basic mappings including multiple RLOCs per EID, priority,
and weight
* Support for storing the following LCAFs: IPv4, IPv6, MAC,
Distinguished Name, Segment ID, Traffic Engineering with Path
Specification, AS Number, Application Specific Data
* Support for Source/Destination 2-Tuple Lookups
* LISP Map Resolver
* Northbound (application facing) REST API for Map Server and Map
Resolver to add/retrieve EID-RLOC (e.g. : virtual IP address to physical
IP address) mappings
* Southbound (device facing) LISP API for Map Server and Map Resolver to
register/request EID-RLOC mappings via LISP protocol

[[helium-release]]
=== Helium Release

* Config command : setShouldOverwriteRloc true, enables overwrite of
mappings instead of appending/merging
* Port support for non proxy map request
* Key-value LCAF support
* Map-Reply in Map Request serialization. we now serialize the embedded
map reply record.
* SMR support. SMR is sent only when mapping is changed via NB API. Auto
subscription for xTR.
* Southbound xTR support. The southbound can now listen on another port
which is the xTR port, and send a notification with the received map
request.
* Adding another address format: a DistinguishedName with value ":"
* Make overwrite behavior configurable in config.ini - keyword:
lisp.mappingOverwrite
* Inventory Service: Register LISP nodes in the node inventory when
Map-Register is received in SB plugin
* Neutron support: When a new neutron subnet is created, the subnet is
added to mapping system with the Neutron net-ID as the key for the EID
(subnet) prefix.
* Netconf: API/ability to programmatically connect to a netconf server
from the LISP project. Not yet a user facing feature.
