* LISP Map Resolver
* Northbound (application facing) REST API for Map Server and Map
Resolver to add/retrieve EID-RLOC (e.g. : virtual IP address to physical
IP address) mappings
* Southbound (device facing) LISP API for Map Server and Map Resolver to
register/request EID-RLOC mappings via LISP protocol

[[helium-release]]
=== Helium Release

* Config command : setShouldOverwriteRloc true, enables overwrite of
mappings instead of appending/merging
* Port support for non proxy map request
* Key-value LCAF support
* Map-Reply in Map Request serialization. we now serialize the embedded
map reply record..

which is the xTR port, and send a notification with the received map
request.
