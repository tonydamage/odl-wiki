==== LISP Overview

Locator ID Separation Protocol
(http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc6830[LISP]) is a technology that
provides a flexible map-and-encap framework that can be used for overlay
network applications, such as data center network virtualization, and
Network Function Virtualization (NFV). LISP introduces two name spaces:
Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs), and Routing Locators (RLOCs). In a
virtualization environment, EIDs can be viewed as virtual address space
and RLOCs can be viewed as physical network address space. The LISP
framework decouples network control plane from the forwarding plane by
providing: (1) a data plane that specifies how the virtualized network
addresses are encapsulated in addresses from the underlying physical
network, and (2) a control plane that stores the mapping of the
virtual-to-physical address spaces and the associated forwarding
policies, and serves this information to the data plane on demand.
Network programmability is achieved by programming forwarding policies
such as transparent mobility, service chaining, and traffic engineering
in the mapping system, where the data plane elements can fetch these
policies on demand as new flows arrive. In this presentation we explain
how the LISP Flow Mapping project in ODL can be used to enable advanced
SDN and NFV use cases.

LISP data plane Tunnel Routers are available at
http://lispmob.org[LISPmob.org] in the open source community on the
following platforms:

* Linux
* Android
* OpenWRT

==== LISP Flow Mapping Overview

The Lisp Flow Mapping service provides
http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc6830[LISP] Mapping System services. This
includes LISP Map-Server and LISP Map-Resolver services, to store and
serve the _mapping data_ to data plane nodes as well as to OpenDaylight
applications. Mapping data can include mapping of virtual addresses to
physical network address where the virtual nodes are reachable/hosted
at. Mapping data can also include a variety of routing policies
including traffic engineering and load balancing. To leverage this
service OpenDaylight applications and services can use the northbound
REST API to define the mappings and policies in the LISP Mapping
Service. Data plane devices capable of LISP control protocol can
leverage this service through a southbound LISP plugin via the LISP
control protocol (Map-Register, Map-Request, Map-Reply messages).

The following figure depicts the described components.

== Architecture Details

The following figure shows the various LISP Flow Mapping modules. A
brief description of each module follows.

image:ODL LISP Modules.jpg[ODL LISP Modules.jpg,title="ODL LISP Modules.jpg"]

* DAO: This is the layer that separates the LISP logic from the Data
Base, so that we can separate the map server and map resolver from the
specific implementation of the DHT (Distributed Hash Table). currently
we have an implementation of this layer with the Controller Cluster
Service as a DHT, but it can be switched to any other DHT, and you only
need to implement the ILispDAO interface.
* Map Server: This is the module that processes the adding or
registration of keys and mappings. For a detailed specification of LISP
Map Server please see http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc6830[LISP].
* Map Resolver: This is the module that receives and processes the
mapping lookup queries and provides the mappings to requester. For a
detailed specification of LISP Map Server please see
http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc6830[LISP].
* Northbound API: This is part of the ODL northbound API. This module
enables defining key-EID associations, as well as adding mapping
information through the Map Server. Key-EID associations can also be
queried via this API. The Northbound API also provides capability of
querying the mapping information for an EID prefix.
* LISP Southbound Plugin: This plugin enables data plane devices that
support LISP control plane protocol (see
http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc6830[LISP]) to register and query
mappings to the LISP Flow Mapping via the LISP control plane protocol.
* API: The API module exposes the Map Server and Map Resolver
capabilities via Java API.
