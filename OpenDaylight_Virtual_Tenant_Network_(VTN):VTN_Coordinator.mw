= VTN Coordinator =
The VTN coordinator realizes Virtual Tenet Network (VTN) provisioning in OpenDaylight Controllers (ODC). In the OpenDaylight architecture VTN Coordinator is part of the network application, orchestration and services layer. It uses OpenDaylight APIs (REST) to construct the virtual network in ODCs. It provides REST APIs for northbound VTN applications and supports virtual networks spanning across multiple ODCs by coordinating across ODCs.

'''VTN Coordinator Components'''

:*[[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):VTN API|VTN API]]                           - VTN Web API Module
:*[[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Transaction Coordinator|TC]]                - Two Phase commit coordinator Module
:*[[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Unified Provider Physical Layer (UPPL)|UPPL]]      - Physical network Provisioning/Monitoring Module
:*[[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Unified Provider Logical Layer (UPLL)|UPLL]]       - Virtual Network Provisioning/Monitoring Module
:*[[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):OpenDaylight Controller Driver (ODC Driver)|ODC Driver]] - OpenDaylight controller interface Module

== VTN API ==
The [[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):VTN API|VTN API]] module provides the north bound REST API interface for VTN applications

== Transaction Coordinator (TC) ==
The [[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Transaction Coordinator|TC]] module provides the two phase commit coordination functionality for VTN coordinator components.

== Unified Provider Physical Layer (UPPL) ==
The [[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Unified Provider Physical Layer (UPPL)|UPPL]] module is a sub component of the VTN Coordinator and provides the Physical network provisioning and monitoring functionality.

= Unified Provider Logical Layer (UPLL) =
:*UPLL is started from lgcnwd daemon during startup of VTN coordinator.
:*Interacts with TC, UPPL and ODC Driver using IPC framework.
:*Receives virtual network configuration Create/Update/Delete/Read requests from VTN Service.
:*Maintains the startup, candidate, and running configurations and state information in an external database
:*Performs the setup/commit/abort operations as instructed by TC
:*Connects to southbound controllers via ODC Driver
:*Constructs and maintains the virtual network topology using the configuration and notifications (events and alarms) received from controller platforms.
:*Supports Audit and Import functionality for the virtual network configurations

= OpenDaylight Controller Driver (ODC Driver) =
:*ODC driver is started during startup of VTN coordinator
:*Interacts with TC, UPPL and UPLL using the IPC framework.
:*Setup and monitor controller connections
:*Translates the provisioning information received from UPLL to corresponding OpenDaylight APIs of the OpenDaylight controller.

= Communication Framework =
'''Internal communication'''
:*Proprietary IPC framework
'''External communication'''
:*North Bound – REST API
:*South Bound – OpenDaylight API
