=== Current Status ===

'''M3 - 4 July''':
We had a notable slip to our own aggressive plans to have our MD-SAL bundle implemented and glued to the PCMM southbound driver.  This was due to resource hits and other project projects pulling.  Also, in a effort to recruit users or developers  I updated our AD-SAL prototype to support another ODL PCMM PoC scheduled for M5.    Ideally if the project could add a team member familiar with the ODL specific workflow it would be helpful to move things faster.. The fact that the current milestones objectives were self imposed targets for MD-SAL functionality and it appears readily recoverable -- a status warrants a YELLOW status.  

'''M2 - 4 June''':
The release plan reviewed for final acceptance with the interested community at large on 6/4.  The southbound driver is about 75% completed being conservative and saying the remaining items with this bundle are IPv6 support and unit testing.  To support unit testing we included simple software version of the CMTS that has now become part of our junit test suite.   We originally had AD-SAL interfaces for the northbound.  We have developed a proposed YANG model and have produced initial stub files.  We are still in learning mode with regard to this task, sorting out these work items, we will have the model we want to support finalized shortly as well.

Project name change request is assumed to be deferred, but proposed name is CableFlow.
M1 task to import source is late and moved to M.  Is there is a require review process for existing sources?
All M2 task will be completed on time, except IPv6 support and additional unit tests will be deferred to M3.
Surekha Bejgam (sbejgam) has graciously offer to help us adjust our pom file to be in conformance, but the task may slip to M3.
