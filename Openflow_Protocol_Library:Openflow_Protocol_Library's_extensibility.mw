== Library's proposed extensibility ==
* [1] The scenario starts in a custom bundle which wants to extend library's functionality. The custom bundle creates (de)serializers which implement exposed OpenflowDeserializer / OpenflowSerializer interfaces. OpenflowDeserializer / OpenflowSerializer are main extensibility interfaces.
** There are some cases that need specific methods. For this purpose one can create interfaces that extend OpenflowDeserializer / OpenflowSerializer and use those.
* [2] Created (de)serializers are paired with DeserializerKey / SerializerKey, which are used for (de)serializer lookup. Paired (de)serializers are passed to OF Plugin.
* [3] OF Plugin injects passed (de)serializers into the OF Library.
