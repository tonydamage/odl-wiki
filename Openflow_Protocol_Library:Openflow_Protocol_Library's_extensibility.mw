Entry point for the extensibility is SwitchConnectionProvider.
SwitchConnectionProvider contains methods for (de)serializer registration. To
register deserializer it is needed to use .registerCustomDeserializer(key, impl).
To register serializer one must use .registerCustomSerializer(key, impl).
Registration can occur either during configuration or at runtime.

Impl is (de)serializer implementation and
must implement OFGeneralDeserializer / OFGeneralSerializer interface. These
interfaces are only empty unifying interfaces. Therefore it is needed to use their descendants that contain appropriate
methods.
