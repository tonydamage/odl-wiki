Entry point for the extensibility is SwitchConnectionProvider.
SwitchConnectionProvider contains methods for (de)serializer registration. To
register deserializer it is needed to use .registerCustomDeserializer(key, impl).
To register serializer one must use .registerCustomSerializer(key, impl).
Registration can occur either during configuration or at runtime.
