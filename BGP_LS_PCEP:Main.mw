BGP/LS and PCEP project is an effort to bring two south-bound plugins into the controller: one for supporting BGP Linkstate Distribution as a source of L3 topology information, the other one to add support for Path Computation Element Protocol as a way to instantiate paths into the underlying network.

== Getting started for users ==

This is the right place to start when using the BGP and/or PCEP protocol implemented in OpenDaylight.

The '''[[BGP LS PCEP:User Guide | User Guide]]''' will navigate you through the configuration needed for both 
protocols to connect to their peers. 

If you are done with configuration, let's view the connections and data already received, through
'''[[BGP_LS_PCEP:Restconf | RESTCONF]]'''.

For advanced PCEP users, this '''[[BGP LS PCEP:Programmer Guide | Programmer Guide]]''' will tell you how to
manipulate LSPs (tunnels) using the PCE protocol.

Let's not forget about security, both PCEP and BGP protocols support MD5. This '''[[BGP LS PCEP:TCP MD5 Guide | TCP MD5 Guide]]''' explains how to enable and configure it.

Problems? Questions? '''[[BGP LS PCEP:Troubleshooting|Troubleshooting]]''' lists common problems reported by
BGPCEP users. If you don't find the answer to your question here, contact ''bgpcep-users@lists.opendaylight.org'' .

== Information for developers ==

These links should be helpful for developers who want to use BGPCEP APIs to create their own components:

'''[[BGP LS PCEP:Component Map|Component Map]]''' is a map listing all the components with a short description and other useful information for each component in both protocols.

If you introduce new PCE messages, objects or TLVs, or if you have a new BGP AFI and SAFI, this '''[[BGP LS PCEP:Developer Guide|Developer Guide]]''' is exactly what you need to link your components with BGPCEP APIs without modifying existing code.

'''[[BGP LS PCEP:Models | YANG Models List]]''' let's you inspect all the YANG models for both BGP and PCEP in one place.
