===Major Features===
Hydrogen release marks the first release of netconf server and config subsystem. Most notable features:
* Configuration system capable of two phase commit
* Configuration APIs and SPIs exposed via JMX config beans
* Runtime statistics and other data exposed via JMX runtime beans
* yang code generator to generate JMX, configuration interfaces and skeletons of Modules and ModuleFactories
* netconf server (plain TCP and ssh) is used as config-subsystem endpoint, wraps JMX config and runtime beans into model driven XML representation
* netconf client with advanced capabilities like reconnection strategies and capability testing
* configuration pusher and persister that delivers initial or current configuration, automatic persisting of changes after netconf commit
* netconf monitoring capability in netconf server
* many low level Java APIs wrapped with yang models and configuration factories, like executor framework, netty threadgroups, logback
* shutdown management via netconf RPC

===Target Environment===

====For Execution====

Same as controller.

====For Development====

Same as controller.

===Known Issues and Limitations===
Security is currently limited to authentication based on UserManager service and ssh endpoint only. There is no authorization implemented - as long as user logs into netconf, there is no way of limiting RPCs called or configuration being changed.
