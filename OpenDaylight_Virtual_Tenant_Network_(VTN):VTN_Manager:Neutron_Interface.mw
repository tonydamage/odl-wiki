= Mapping from Neutron to VTN =
== Mapping from Neutron Objects ==
=== Tenants ===
Tenants in OpenStack are mapped to VTN. This is created implicitly as the OpenStack tenant API is not part of Neutron.
The mapping is handled when a network create operation is received, if necessary, a VTN is created for the OpenStack tenant that is referred to by the Network create operation. The Tenant identifier is mapped to the VTN identifier.

=== Networks ===
Neutron Networks are mapped to vBridges in VTN. The mapping is straightforward as each Network is mapped to a vBridge. In OpenStack, a network is an L2 broadcast domain, the same applies for vBridge in the VTN context. The NetworkUUID is mapped to the vBridge identifier.

VTN does not support the shared network concept supported by Neutron. The shared attribute should be set to false for VTN to create a network.

VTN supports provider network 	extension attributes of Neutron Network. The following attributes should be configured for VTN to created networks.
provider:network_type = vlan
provider:segmentation_id = a valid VLAN identifier.

=== Ports ===
The Neutron Ports are mapped to vBridge Interfaces in VTN. As endpoint of physical port information is not available in the Neutron Ports, the vBridge interfaces are not mapped to physical ports in the VTN networks. The PORTUUID is mapped to vBridge interface identifier.
