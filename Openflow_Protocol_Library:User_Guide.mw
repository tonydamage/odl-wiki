Library is started and configured by Openflow Plugin. Library can be started and configured also by itself (via Integration test).

=== Startup in Openflow Plugin (or other component)===
Any component that wants to use the library's funcionality needs to import the library's bundle. To start the library it is needed to:
* 1. configure,
* 2. inject SwitchConnectionHandler,
* 3. start the library

NOTE: detailed description and diagram can be found here: [[Openflow_Protocol_Library:Openflow_Protocol_Library%27s_lifecycle|Library's lifecycle]]

=== Startup in the library ===
* 1. Navigate to IntegrationTest.java
* 2. Uncomment @Test anotation above testCommunicationWithVM() method
* 3. Set the desired listening port in the setUp() method (see configuration part below)
* 4. Run the testCommunicationWithVM()
** Modify MockPlugin.java to test some scenarios with vswitch
