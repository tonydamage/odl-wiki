==Qualification test definition==

These tests are intended to provide minimal functional tests to ensure that OpenDaylight can be run successfully on a number of popular platforms.  Testing will adopt the [[CrossProject:Integration_Group:Create_System_Test_Environment | test procedure]] defined by the Integration working group.

Tests will focus on the base edition using default startup configuration and the basic mininet tests.
