= Installation Guides for VTN System =

VTN Coordinator runs outside of OpenDaylight Controller.
On the other hand, VTN Manager is implemented as OSGi bundles, and runs in OpenDaylight Controller.

The requirements for these two are slightly different.
Therefore, we recommend that you install VTN Manager and VTN Coordinator in different machines.

= Installing ODC and VTN Coordinator in the same machine =

For installing OpenDaylight Controller and VTN Coordinator in the same machine,
there are two issues you should take care of.

== Java version ==

Use Java 1.6.

VTN Cooridnator requires Java 1.6.
On the other hand, it is recommend to use Java 1.7+ for OpenDaylight Controller.

However, as the following page said, OpenDaylight Controller can run on Java 1.6, so use Java 1.6 to run OpenDaylight Controller with VTN Manager and VTN Coordinator in the same machine.

== Port Number ==
Both OpenDaylight Controller and VTN Coordinator (Tomcat) use 8080/TCP.

To avoid this conflict, change the port number of VTN Coordinator (Tomcat) as follows:
