== Known Issues and Limitations

* IdMLight Admin endpoint (/auth/v1) and Federation endpoint
(/oauth2/federation) are not exposed by default (for security reasons).
To expose them, please modify Karaf's etc/jetty.xml file as described
in: https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/11425
* Installing Restconf complaining about TokenAuthFilter not found.
** Problem: The following error is returned when trying to install
RESTCONF: The class org.opendaylight.aaa.sts.TokenAuthFilter could not
be found.
** Solution: The error occurred because AAA is not installed and
authentication is not in place. To install authentication for use with
RESTCONF (assumed installed already), run the following commands:
*** feature:install odl-aaa-authn
*** feature:uninstall odl-resfconf
*** feature:install odl-restconf
