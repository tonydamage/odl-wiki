This page contains a registry of features supported in the develop branch of lispflowmapping project as they are added, organized by the releases that they were added in.


== Feature Registry ==


=== Hydrogen Release ===

* LISP Map Server with flat key-value mappings
* Support for basic mappings including multiple RLOCs per EID, priority, and weight
* Support for storing the following LCAFs: IPv4, IPv6, MAC, Distinguished Name, Segment ID, Traffic Engineering with Path Specification, AS Number, Application Specific Data
* Support for Source/Destination 2-Tuple Lookups
* LISP Map Resolver
* Northbound (application facing) REST API for Map Server and Map Resolver to add/retrieve EID-RLOC (e.g. : virtual IP address to physical IP address) mappings
* Southbound (device facing) LISP API for Map Server and Map Resolver to register/request EID-RLOC mappings via LISP protocol

=== Helium Release ===

* Config command : setShouldOverwriteRloc true, enables overwrite of mappings instead of appending/merging
* Port support for non proxy map request
* Key-value LCAF support 
* Map-Reply in Map Request serialization. we now serialize the embedded map reply record..
* SMR support. SMR is sent only when mapping is changed via NB API.
* Southbound xTR support. The southbound can now listen on another port which is the xTR port, and send a notification with the received map request.
* Adding another address format: a DistinguishedName with value "<ip>:<port>"
* Make overwrite behavior configurable in config.ini - keyword: lisp.mappingOverwrite
