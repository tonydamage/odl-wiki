== Introduction ==

Continuous Integration Test (CIT) Java area is here to help developers with writing good Java integration tests. Integration tests are also JUnit tests that are executed during code build.


== Continuous Integration Tests ==

Currently we have 2 types of Java integration tests:

* Integration Test using PAX-EXAM framework to test a set of OSGi bundles. Check [[OpenDaylight Controller:Integration Tests|Instructions on Writing Integration Tests]]
* Northbound Integration test for testing NB REST APIs. Check [[OpenDaylight Controller:Northbound Integration Tests|Instructions on Writing Northbound Integration Tests]]

In addition we have 1 integration test job:

* Integration test job to re-build the code when changes on dependencies are detected. Check [[GettingStarted:Jenkins Integration Job Setup|Jenkins Integration Job Setup]]
