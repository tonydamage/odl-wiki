== Introduction ==
Continuous Integration Test (CIT) Java area is here to help developers with writing good Java integration tests. <br\>

== Continuous Integration Test types ==
Currently we have 3 types of Java integration tests:

* Integration Test using PAX-EXAM framework. This allows to test a set of OSGi bundles. Check [[OpenDaylight Controller:Integration Tests|Instructions on Writing Integration Tests]]
* Northbound Integration test. This allows to test NB REST APIs. Check [[OpenDaylight Controller:Northbound Integration Tests|Instructions on Writing Northbound Integration Tests]]
* Integration test job. This is just a Jenkins job to track changes on dependency projects. Check [[GettingStarted:Jenkins Integration Job Setup|Jenkins Integration Job Setup]]
