== Introduction ==
Continuous Integration Test (CIT) Java area is here to help developers with writing good Java integration tests.

== Continuous Integration Test types ==
Currently we have 3 types of Java integration tests:

* Integration Test using PAX-EXAM framework to test a set of OSGi bundles. Check [[OpenDaylight Controller:Integration Tests|Instructions on Writing Integration Tests]]
* Northbound Integration test for testing NB REST APIs. Check [[OpenDaylight Controller:Northbound Integration Tests|Instructions on Writing Northbound Integration Tests]]
* Integration test job to re-build the code when changes on dependencies are detected. Check [[GettingStarted:Jenkins Integration Job Setup|Jenkins Integration Job Setup]]
