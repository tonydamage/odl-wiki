* Sharon showed the Data Collection POC demo that listens to the
DataChangeEvent notification and prints out the captured open flow
statistics data on console.
* There were some discussion about performance optimization around
listening to the notification, which Sharon and Basheer will follow up
with update.
* YuLing went through the release plan and everyone agreed with the
following items:

1.  HBase is going to be the default data store of TSDR. We will not
support another data store in Lithium. Packaging and Installation will
be taken care of so that the user will only need to untar one tar
ball(combine HBase tar with ODL tar), and odl feature installation will
start hbase server on localhost.
2.  Data Query Support: In M4, we will attempt develop restconf based
Data Query service. If there’s time limit, command line based queries
will be available for the user to pull data from TSDR.
3.  HA/Clustering: No TSDR HA/Clustering support in Lithium.

* Basheer reviewed Data Collection Design with the group and will
receive offline comments if any.
* For Data Storage Service Design posted online, please review and send
out offline comments. A meeting will be called if we receive large
number of comments. Otherwise, we’ll leverage the upcoming weekly
meetings to resolve the design comments.
* Action item:

1.  For YuLing to update release plan according to today’s discussion.
2.  For Sharon to send out links/steps for using mininet to test with
DataCollection POC.
