In the Hydrogen release The Netconf Client (NCC) must be configured with the address and login credentials (username/password) for each Netconf Server to which it connects.

The yang model for NCC confugration can be found at [https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/gitweb?p=controller.git;f=opendaylight/md-sal/sal-netconf-connector/src/main/yang/odl-sal-netconf-connector-cfg.yang [controller:opendaylight/md-sal/sal-netconf-connector/src/main/yang/odl-sal-netconf-connector-cfg.yang<nowiki>]</nowiki>]

=Configuring Netconf client with yangcli-pro=

== Requirements ==
yangcli-pro version 13.04-7.1 or later

== Prerequisites & Limitations ==

yangcli-pro currently can not process the ODL network-topology model. It needs to be excluded from the list of models exported by the Configuration server to its clients. Open the ''configuration/config.ini'' file and add the network-topology model to the yangstore blacklist:

Before:
<pre>
yangstore.blacklist=.*controller.model.*
</pre>

After:
<pre>
yangstore.blacklist=.*controller.model.*
</pre>
