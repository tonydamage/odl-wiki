In the Hydrogen release The Netconf Client (NCC) must be configured with the address and login credentials (username/password) for each target Netconf Server to which it connects.

The yang model for NCC configuration can be found at {{git/link|controller.git|opendaylight/md-sal/sal-netconf-connector/src/main/yang/odl-sal-netconf-connector-cfg.yang}}. The per target Server configuration includes the target Server's IP address, port, connection type (TCP or SSH), and username/password. There is also global NCC configuration that includes MD-SAL reference and the configuration of NCC's thread group for opening and maintaining sockets and its event executor for sourcing events into MD-SAL. Defaults values for global configuration, defined in this page, should be used in most cases.

=Configuring Netconf client with yangcli-pro=

== Requirements ==
yangcli-pro version 13.04-7.1 or later

== Prerequisites & Limitations ==

yangcli-pro currently can not process the ODL network-topology model. It needs to be excluded from the list of models exported by the Configuration Subsystem to its clients. Make sure that .*.model.ietf-topology.* is present in the ''configuration/config.ini'' file where the yangstore blacklist is defined. For example:

<pre>
yangstore.blacklist=.*controller.model.* | .*.model.ietf-topology.*
</pre>
