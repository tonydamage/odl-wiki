# Track the status of your deliverables
#* Add a "status" column to your deliverables in your release plan.
#** Making the status a link to the relevant bug is also a really good way to track things and give a link to more details.
#** A good example of both is the [[BGP-LS/PCEP:Helium_Release_Plan#Release_Milestones BGP-LS/PCEP Release Milestones]]
#* Ideally, we would use a small (small) set of terms with matching colors/styles, e.g., (feel encouraged to just copy the wikitext)

#** "<font style="background-color: tomato">BLOCKED</font>" means the project can't deliver this because of a dependency on something outside the project
#*** should list the thing being blocked on as concretely as possible, e.g., a deliverable in another project, ideally with a link to a bug in bugzilla
#** "<font style="background-color: lightgray"><s>DROPPED</s></font>"
#*** should be accompanied by a mail to the discuss mailing list explaining that the the feature is no longer going to be delivered
#* We will be creating a spreadsheet to track this across projects, please update this with the ''worst'' status across your deliverables.
# Identify the projects you are depending on and start a discussion with them
#* Make sure they understand what you need and are planning on it.
#* If you want to be more awesome, list the dependencies with a status similar to
