= Topology : Notification =

Currently, the openflowplugin has a test-provider that allows you to get Notifications for the Topology related events like Link-Discovered , Link-Removed events.

== Link Discovered Event : Testing ==

From the
<pre>
cd openflowplugin/distribution/base/target/distributions-openflowplugin-base-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-osgipackage/opendaylight
./run.sh
</pre>

Point your mininet at the controller as described above.

Once the Controller is connected to the switch, Link Discovered event can be tested by initially configuring the specific flows on the switch.
For Link Discovered Event either Table-miss flow or LLDP ether-type flow can be configured 

Configuring Table-Miss flow using OpenflowpluginTestCommandProvider
<pre>
addMDFlow Openflow:1 fTM
</pre>
You can go confirm they were created on the switch.

Once the table-miss flow is configured through above command, we can see the Link-Discovered Event in the debug logs on the controller console

Configuring LLDP ether-type flow using OpenflowpluginTestCommandProvider
<pre>
addMDFlow Openflow:1 0(table-id) f81
</pre>
You can go confirm they were created on the switch.

Once the LLDP ether-type flow is configured through above command, we can see the Link-Discovered Event in the debug logs on the controller console

== Link Removed Event : Testing ==

Having configured either, table-miss or lldp ether-type flow on switch, once the switch is disconnected we see the Link Removed Events
