== Description

SDNAs collectively referred to various of applications or devices
including the Software Defined Price (SDP) module. The SDP module mainly
takes charge of the resources’ price. you can get wanted resources
through calling rest api from different servers or platforms, absolutely
you must pay for it. So we need the SDP, which can automatically fix a
price for resources. In SDP, Developer can put your pricing mechanism
into the SDP module, or you can use the included pricing mechanism.

=== Software Defined Price (SDP)

We intent to design the Software Defined Price (SDP) in order to the
rational use of resources. The Project contained the SDP module offer
resourses to caller,and the caller must takes price1 to buy the
resources or successfully calling a program. Similarly,the project must
buy resources or call a program from lower lay,and it will cost price2.
In SDP, The developer can put their designed price algorithm into this
framework, so the price algorithm makes price2 become price1. The SDP
module includes the project of the generic price negotiation module and
the generic trade module.

''' Generic Price Negotiation module '''

Generally speaking, the generic price negotiation module lies between
the data plane elements and the controller platform, also between the
controller platform and the network applications orchestrations &
services. In the process of selecting and negotiating using needs and
budget constraints, the goal is to get the most optimal level of service
quality under the service consumer determines the budget constraints.

''' Generic Trade module '''

The Generic Trade Module is primarily responsible for the pricing of
resources、user’s transaction and balance. It mainly consists of Virtual
Resource submodule, Expenditure submodule, Pricing submodule, Balance
submodule, Account submodule .

module,title="|400px|thumb|center|Generic Trade module"]

* Virtual Resource submodule:
** include the underlying physical resources、all of the user’s
behavior; include the changes of daily traffic, all of these records
will be stored into the database
* Expenditure submodule:
** include the user’s consumption behavior and trade behavior
* Pricing submodule:
** analyze the distribution of the flow in each time interval and each
link through the long time user’s behaviors, and then determine the
price of that resources used by users
* Settlement submodule:
** be used to settle a account for the user’s expenditure
* Account submodule:
** include the user’s account, password, balance and the identification
to the users

The Generic Trade module provides a generic interface—CommonPrice,
including two methods: public Double getPrice()\{} and public void
algorithm()\{}. The method getPrice() is responsible for returning a
price for every resource, while the method algorithm() offers a method
of achieving any algorithm.
