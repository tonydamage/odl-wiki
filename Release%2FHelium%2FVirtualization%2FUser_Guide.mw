===Installation Guide (link)===
The installation instructions for the Virtualization edition can be found [https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Release/Hydrogen/Virtualization/Installation_Guide here]

===Installation Troubleshooting (link)===
A hyperlink to a list of troubleshooting steps for installation of the edition

===Configuration===
* In order to configure OpenDaylight Virtualization edition using OpenFlow 1.3 plugin, start Opendaylight Controller with ''-of13'' option. Otherwise, it will use the OpenFlow 1.0.  

* To start mininet for OF13 simulation for example do: ''mininet> sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=a.b.c.d --topo tree,2 --switch ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow13'' 

* To start mininet for OF10 simulation for example do:  ''mininet> sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=10.125.136.52 --topo tree,2''
