===Installation Guide (link)===
The installation instructions for the Virtualization edition can be found [https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Release/Hydrogen/Virtualization/Installation_Guide here]

===Installation Troubleshooting (link)===

===Configuration===
* In order to configure OpenDaylight Virtualization edition using OpenFlow 1.3 plugin, start Opendaylight Controller with ''-of13'' option. Otherwise, it will use the OpenFlow 1.0.  

* To start mininet for OF13 simulation for example do: ''mininet> sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=a.b.c.d --topo tree,2 --switch ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow13'' 

* To start mininet for OF10 simulation for example do:  ''mininet> sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=10.125.136.52 --topo tree,2''

==OpenDOVE==

===Overview and Architecture===
* DOVE (distributed overlay virtual Ethernet) is a network virtualization platform that provides isolated multi-tenant networks on any IP network in a virtualized data center. DOVE provides each tenant with a virtual network abstraction providing layer-2 or layer-3 connectivity and the ability to control communication using access control policies. Address dissemination and policy enforcement in DOVE is provided by a clustered directory service. It also includes a gateway function to enable virtual machines on a virtual network to communicate with hosts outside the virtual network domain.

* Users interact with Open DOVE to create and manage virtual networks through the Open DOVE Management Console (DMC) which provides a REST API for programmatic virtual network management and a basic graphical UI. The DMC is also used to configure the Open DOVE Gateway to configure connectivity to external, non-virtualized networks.

* The Open DOVE Connectivity Server (DCS) supplies address and policy information to individual Open DOVE vswitches which implement virtual networks by encapsulating tenant traffic in overlays that span virtualized hosts in the data center. The DCS also includes support for high-availability and scale-out deployments through a lightweight clustering protocol between replicated DCS instances. The Open DOVE vswitches serve as policy enforcement points for traffic entering virtual networks. Open DOVE uses the VxLAN encapsulation format but implements a scalable control plane that does not require the use of IP multicast in the data center.

* The DOVE technology was originally developed by IBM Research and has also been included in commercial products.

* The below diagram shows an overall DOVE architecture:
