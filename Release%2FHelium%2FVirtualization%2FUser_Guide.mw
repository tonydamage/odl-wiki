==Overview and Architecture==
The Virtualization edition of OpenDaylight is geared towards data centers. It includes the OVSDB protocol southbound and the Affinity Service, VTN, DOVE, and the OpenStack Service. The following diagram shows OpenDaylight Base Edition architecture in details:
<br />

==Installation==
The installation instructions for the Virtualization edition can be found [https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Release/Hydrogen/Virtualization/Installation_Guide here]

==Configuration==
To configure OpenDaylight Virtualization edition using the OpenFlow 1.3 plugin, start Opendaylight Controller with the ''-of13'' option. If you do not use the option, the controller will use the OpenFlow 1.0 version. 

* To start mininet for the OpenFlow 1.3 simulation, use the following command: ''mininet> sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=a.b.c.d --topo tree,2 --switch ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow13'' 

* To start mininet for the OpenFlow 1.0 simulation, use the following command:  ''mininet> sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=10.125.136.52 --topo tree,2''

==Web / Graphical Interface==
The graphical user interface is the same as the one for [https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Release/Hydrogen/Base/User_Guide#Web_.2F_Graphical_Interface Base edition].

==Release Notes==
The release note for the Virtualization Edition can be found [https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Release/Hydrogen/Virtualization/Release_Notes here].

==OVSDB==

===Overview and Architecture===
* OVSDB Integration is a bundle for OpenDaylight that will implement the Open vSwitch Database management protocol, allowing southbound configuration of vSwitches. It is a critical protocol for Network Virtualization with Open vSwitch forwarding elements.
* OVSDB neutron bundle in Virtualization edition supports Network Virtualization using VXLAN & GRE tunnel for Openstack and Cloudstack deployments
The below diagram shows the OVSDB architecture for Neutron:

==Virtual Tenant Network (VTN)==
OpenDaylight Virtual Tenant Network (VTN) is an application that provides multi-tenant virtual network on an SDN controller.

The below diagram shows the VTN architecture:

==Affinity==

===Overview and Architecture===

* The Affinity service provides an API to allow controller and higher-level applications to create and share an abstract, topology and implementation independent description of the infrastructure needs, preferences and behaviors of workloads that use the network to "talk" to one another.

* The detailed description of the project can be found [https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Project_Proposals:Affinity_Metadata_Service here].

===Programmatic Interfaces===
Affinity API and implementation in OpenDaylight can be found [https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/File:Opendaylight_affinity_API.pdf here].

==OpenDOVE==

===Overview and Architecture===
* DOVE (distributed overlay virtual Ethernet) is a network virtualization platform that provides isolated multi-tenant networks on any IP network in a virtualized data center. DOVE provides each tenant with a virtual network abstraction providing layer-2 or layer-3 connectivity and the ability to control communication using access control policies. Address dissemination and policy enforcement in DOVE is provided by a clustered directory service. It also includes a gateway function to enable virtual machines on a virtual network to communicate with hosts outside the virtual network domain.

* Users interact with Open DOVE to create and manage virtual networks through the Open DOVE Management Console (DMC) which provides a REST API for programmatic virtual network management and a basic graphical UI. The DMC is also used to configure the Open DOVE Gateway to configure connectivity to external, non-virtualized networks.

* The Open DOVE Connectivity Server (DCS) supplies address and policy information to individual Open DOVE vswitches which implement virtual networks by encapsulating tenant traffic in overlays that span virtualized hosts in the data center. The DCS also includes support for high-availability and scale-out deployments through a lightweight clustering protocol between replicated DCS instances. The Open DOVE vswitches serve as policy enforcement points for traffic entering virtual networks. Open DOVE uses the VxLAN encapsulation format but implements a scalable control plane that does not require the use of IP multicast in the data center.

* The DOVE technology was originally developed by IBM Research and has also been included in commercial products.

* The below diagram shows an overall DOVE architecture:
