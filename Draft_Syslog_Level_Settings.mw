The following table is recommended syslog levels for various items to be logged.  This table should not be read that a particular event is required to be logged, but that if it is logged, that level should be used.

{| border=1
  |+ Syslog Levels and Information
|-
  ! Syslog Level
  ! Information
|-
  | debug
  | method entrace, method exit, trace information
|-
  | info
  | missing parameter being set to default value (include value)
|-
  | notice
  | bundle start and stop
|-
  | warning
  | entered a failure branch, but execution can continue
|-
  | error
  | entered a failure branch and method exiting (includes throwing an error)
|-
  | crit
  | failure mode, bundle aborting
|-
  | alert
  | unused
|-

With these definitions, default logging level would be notice

# At least one person has read this as asking folks to stick in a debug log statement on each entry/exit to a function.
''Introduction added to clarify that table is not a requirement to log, but a recommendation to use a particular level if logging is doned''
