The following table is recommended syslog levels for various items to be logged.  This table should not be read that a particular event is required to be logged, but that if it is logged, that level should be used.

{| border=1
  |+ Logback Levels and Information
|-
  ! Logback Request Level
  ! Information
|-
  | TRACE
  | method entrace and exit, block entrance and exit, messages received or sent from the wire
|-
  | DEBUG
  | missing parameter being set to default value
|-
  | INFO
  | module start and stop
|-
  | WARN
  | entered a failure branch, whether method continues or exits
|-
  | ERROR
  | failure mode, bundle aborting
|}

With these definitions, default effective level would be set to INFO

# At least one person has read this as asking folks to stick in a debug log statement on each entry/exit to a function. ''Introduction added to clarify that table is not a requirement to log, but a recommendation to use a particular level if logging is done''
# ''Reclassified levels to match those available in Logback architecture''
