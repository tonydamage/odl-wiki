The User Guide is broken up into two primary use case tutorials. Both Assume you have a functioning OVSDB environment that can be found in the [[OVSDB:Installation Guide|Installation Guide]].

== OVSDB Mininet Tutorial Using the CLI and REST API (Beginner) ==

This is a good place to start to begin understanding the configuration management aspects of OVSDB.

== OpenDaylight OVSDB OpenFlow v1.3 OpenStack Integration '''(Very Advanced)''' ==
This tutorial is not for the feint of heart. Deep understanding of troubleshooting [http://devstack.org DevStack] knowledge is required as to merely get OpenStack running prior even to the OVSDB components.

The integration is unique because it uses only native standardized protocols and is an agentless implementation.

The OpenStack integration architecture uses the following technologies:

* RFC 7047 [http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7047/ OVSDB Open vSwitch Database] 
* OpenFlow v1.3
* OpenStack ML2 Plugin

There will be a stable [http://openstack.redhat.com/Main_Page RDO OpenStack] integration in the next couple of weeks that will be significantly easier to consume.
