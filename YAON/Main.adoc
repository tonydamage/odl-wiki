[[introduction]]
== Introduction

YAON or Yet Another Overlay Manager is a Network Virtualization solution
based developed as a NorthBound application over OpenDaylight. It
utilizes the network fabric as visible to OpenDaylight to create virtual
networks using
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mahalingam-dutt-dcops-vxlan-09[VXLAN]
as transport.

In the prototype stage, YAON is being targetted for creating virtual
networks over a fabric consisting of OpenvSwitch network elements. Just
like Open_DOVE:Main[OpenDOVE], YAON is for creating Overlay - that is,
modifying the edges of network for creating end-points and considering
all intermediate network elements as transparent path (through use of
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mahalingam-dutt-dcops-vxlan-09[VXLAN]).
