Binding Specification v2 builds on experience we gathered with YANG code
generation and building applications using YANG modeled entities, and
is to address issues in design of Binding Specification v1 and improve
usability of 

=== Binding-Specification specific methods and fields conflict with YANG modeled entities ===

Binding-specific methods currently uses same pattern for getters and setters generated for YANG modeled structures, which makes
impossible to provide getters and setters for this YANG modeled structures.

Properties currently defined by YANG Binding:

* key, getKey() - higher possibility of collision by YANG models
* implementedInterface, getImplementedInterface() - low possibility of collision

Solution is to not use get prefix for properties defined by Binding Specification,
and leave it only for YANG modeled properties.

==== Affected Existing Code ====

- Protocol libraries using getImplementedInterface() - simple rename of call of method to implementedInterface().

- getKey(), setKey() - most of the existing code, creating YANG modeled entities, this would require change in lot 
  of code. Changes could be minimized by still generating deprecated getKey(),setKey() for YANG entities where there is no conflict.
