== Testing

To enable testing of your existing features files:

1.  Change your from pom to jar
2.  Make sure none of your dependencies on other features have scope
runtime
3.  Add a dependency on mvn:org.opendaylight.odlparent/features-test
4.  Add dependency on
mvn:org.opendaylight.controller/opendaylight-karaf-empty/
5.  Add a surefire directive to run the test
6.  mvn clean install

[[make-sure-none-of-your-dependencies-on-other-features-have-scope-runtime]]
=== Make sure none of your dependencies on other features have scope
runtime

If you have any dependencies like:

--------------------------------------------------------
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.opendaylight.controller</groupId>
      <artifactId>features-config-persister</artifactId>
      <classifier>features</classifier>
      <type>xml</type>
      <scope>runtime</scope>
    </dependency>
--------------------------------------------------------

change them to be like:

--------------------------------------------------------
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.opendaylight.controller</groupId>
      <artifactId>features-config-persister</artifactId>
      <classifier>features</classifier>
      <type>xml</type>
    </dependency>
--------------------------------------------------------

[[change-your-from-pom-to-jar]]
=== Change your from pom to jar

Towards the top of your existing in your features/pom.xml project you
will likely have:

--------------------------
<packaging>pom</packaging>
--------------------------

Change it to

--------------------------
<packaging>jar</packaging>
--------------------------

We do this because surefire tests will not run on packaging pom.

[[add-a-dependency-on-mvnorg.opendaylight.odlparentfeatures-test]]
=== Add a dependency on mvn:org.opendaylight.odlparent/features-test

At the bottom of your features/pom.xml section add

---------------------------------------------------
    <!-- test to validate features.xml -->
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.opendaylight.odlparent</groupId>
      <artifactId>features-test</artifactId>
    </dependency>
---------------------------------------------------

If you need to set the version, it is currently 0.6.2-SNAPSHOT. It is
recommended you do this in your parent pom.xml section.

[[add-dependency-on-mvnorg.opendaylight.controlleropendaylight-karaf-empty]]
=== Add dependency on
mvn:org.opendaylight.controller/opendaylight-karaf-empty/

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    <!-- dependency for opendaylight-karaf-empty for use by testing -->
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.opendaylight.controller</groupId>
      <artifactId>opendaylight-karaf-empty</artifactId>
      <version>1.4.2-SNAPSHOT</version>
      <type>zip</type>
    </dependency>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

[[add-a-surefire-directive-to-run-the-test]]
=== Add a surefire directive to run the test

In your features/pom.xml at the bottom of the section add:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
          <systemPropertyVariables>
            <karaf.distro.groupId>org.opendaylight.controller</karaf.distro.groupId>
            <karaf.distro.artifactId>opendaylight-karaf-empty</karaf.distro.artifactId>
            <karaf.distro.version>${commons.opendaylight.version}</karaf.distro.version>
          </systemPropertyVariables>
          <dependenciesToScan>
           <dependency>org.opendaylight.odlparent:features-test</dependency>
          </dependenciesToScan>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This will cause the features-test to be run as part of your build. Note:
currently:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<commons.opendaylight.version>1.4.2-SNAPSHOT</commons.opendaylight.version>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

*WARNING*: This only works with surefire versions since 2.15. odlparent
is currently on 2.16, but that is set as a variable, not a dependency in
dependency managment. Insufficent care in specifying this version can
cause the random selection of version 2.12.4 which *will* break.

[[mvn-clean-install]]
=== mvn clean install

The tests for your feature will now run at every build.

[[it-doesnt-run-the-tests]]
== It doesn't run the tests

I'm seeing "SingleFeatureTest.initializationError Â» Unmarshal unexpected
element (uri:"", ..." when i build. This is caused by not having all of
the schemas in your features element.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<features name="odl-bgpcep-${project.version}" xmlns="http://karaf.apache.org/xmlns/features/v1.2.0"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://karaf.apache.org/xmlns/features/v1.2.0 http://karaf.apache.org/xmlns/features/v1.2.0">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your features element should look something like above.

[[karaf-distribution-folder-file-guide]]
== Karaf Distribution Folder / File Guide

The link:Karaf Distribution Folder and File Guide[Karaf Distribution
Folder and File Guide] attempts to explain what files / folders exist in
the karaf distributions that are built and where you can find common
files etc.

== The things, where they are, and why

[[tests]]
=== Tests

There is a test available to test whether all of the features in a
feature.xml file load at the osgi level. It is in yangtools because:

1.  The autorelease requires there be no dependency cycles between
projects
2.  Yangtools needs the tests to check its own features
3.  We want everyone to be able to use the test
4.  The only other project that could house it would be odlparent pom,
and it is outside of its very narrow
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Project_Proposals:ODL_Root_Parent[
scope ].

[[opendaylight-karaf-empty]]
=== opendaylight-karaf-empty

In order for the tests to be valid, there needs to be a completely empty
karaf distro, that contains no features, but does contains some
necessary config resources. This distro lives in controller, as that's
the first place its used, and should never ever have any 'features' in
it.

[[per-project-distros]]
=== Per project distros

Each project may (and probably will want to) have a local distribution
for itself that imports its own local features. (see for example:
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/10114/ )

[[integration-features.xml-repo]]
=== Integration features.xml repo

In the integration project, a simple registry of existing features of
other projects. Only features that are known to load at the OSGI level,
and which have passes the OSGI load test should be listed here. (see
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/10118/ )

[[integration-karaf-distribution]]
=== Integration karaf distribution

In the integration project, a simple distribution which *only* depends
on the integration features.xml (the registry). No features should be
loaded at default. Features should be loaded on demands as desired.

(see https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/10118/ )
