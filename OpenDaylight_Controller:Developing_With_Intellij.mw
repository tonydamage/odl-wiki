The instructions below assume you already have pulled the code from the remote server either via CLI or Eclipse.


* Install IntelliJ (there is a community edition)  
http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/free_java_ide.html
* Run IntelliJ (make sure you have set JAVA_HOME variable first)
/yourIntelliJInstallLocation/bin/idea.sh
* In order to open the controller project, do:
  File-->Open Project

Select the pom.xml located here:
/opendaylight/controller/opendaylight/distribution/opendaylight
It should then open the project structure on the left pane.
(there is a package-based view as well similar to Eclipse. In order to switch to it, select in left upper corner of the left pane: "view as: Packages")

It also detects automatically the project is working with Git and its settings, and the right click menu adjusts to the Git integration.
