The instructions below assume you already have pulled the code from the remote server either via CLI or Eclipse.


* Install IntelliJ (there is a community edition)  
http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/free_java_ide.html
* Run IntelliJ (make sure you have set JAVA_HOME variable first)
/yourIntelliJInstallLocation/bin/idea.sh
* In order to open the controller project, do:
  File-->Open Project

Select the pom.xml located here:
/opendaylight/controller/
It should then open the project structure on the left pane.
(there is a package-based view as well similar to Eclipse. In order to switch to it, select in left upper corner of the left pane: "view as: Packages")

Building with Maven:


Git:
Intellij detects automatically the project is working with Git and its settings, and the right click menu adjusts to the Git integration.
If it didn't detect, check if source control is enabled in the VCS menu optoin
