== Security Considerations

* YANGTools libraries are design to be embedded and not to be
stand-alone application so security concerns needs to be addressed by
application using this library.

[[quality-assurance-test-coverage-etc]]
== Quality Assurance (test coverage, etc)

* The code is covered by unit tests, test coverage is tracked in
https://sonar.opendaylight.org/dashboard/index/org.opendaylight.yangtools:yangtools-aggregator[Sonar]

Helium release marks 53% of unit tests Coverage (56.5% line coverage,
44.4% branch coverage), where coverage is higher for critical
components, for experimental, EOL and non critical components coverage
is lesser.

* Sonar also reports technical debt issues - 1,026 issues which is
partly caused by EOL classes.

:* Helium-1: 10 - Non critical bugs, which does not prevent Helium
release, but bugfixes requires extended qualification before merged.
