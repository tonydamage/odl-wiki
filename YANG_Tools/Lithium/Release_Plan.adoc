|Name |Description
a| |YANG Parser must provide extensibility framework, which will alow
third-party code to process extensions and modify / annotate semantic
model to incorporate such extensions and their semantic meaning in
schema context.

a| |Semantic validation of data tree driven by YANG model and
constraints expressions. Planned support for following constraints:
range, length, pattern, leafref.

a| |Dynamic sharding and enforcement of validation of leafrefs requires
easily processable referential intergrity context, which captures
relationship between schema subtrees which are related by leafrefs
(referenced subtree and referencing subtree).

a| |Implementation of YANG parser support for third-party extension
hadlers and semantic model extension.

a| |Implement parser support for parsing YIN input instead of YANG input

a| |Schema transformation support for producing YANG / YIN text derived
from parsed model.

== Expected Incompatibilities with Other Projects

Currently not known any incompatible project.

[[compatibility-with-previous-releases]]
== Compatibility with Previous Releases

[[removed-apis-andor-functionality]]
=== Removed APIs and/or Functionality

*
* Deprecated Yang Parser APIs, which were deprecated during Helium
release. (TBD: Link to tracking bug)

[[deprecated-apis-andor-functionality]]
=== Deprecated APIs and/or Functionality

* Some of APIs / concepts present in YANG Model API, YANG Parser API and
Yang Parser Implementation,
** these APIs will be Deprecated when replacement APIs / features are
done. Migration and replacement will be documented as part of JavaDoc
for deprecated APIs.
** Backwards compatibility is to be preserved for Lithium.

[[changed-apis-andor-functionality]]
=== Changed APIs and/or Functionality

* Yang Model APIs - addition of new concepts, better expresivity of
Model APIs. (TBD: Link to tracking bug)
* Yang Model Utilities, which were deprecated during Helium release.
(TBD: Link to tracking bug)

[[themes-and-priorities]]
== Themes and Priorities

* Decreasing Technical Debt
* Better Extensibility
* Performance Improvements

[[requests-from-other-projects]]
== Requests from Other Projects

For each API / feature request, the requesting project MUST:

* open Enhancement bug in Bugzilla describing request with Issue Type:
Improvement, Change Request or New Feature
* create an entry as described in
Simultaneous_Release:Per-Project_Lithium_Release_Plan_Template#Example_Request[Release
Plan - Request template], which will also contain number / link to the
bug. After creating the entry, the requesting project MUST:

:* send an e-mail to release@lists.opendaylight.org (mandated by
Simultaneous Release)

:* and both projects' dev lists using this template (mandated by
Simultaneous Release)
