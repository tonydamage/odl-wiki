[[class-and-interface-names]]
== Class and Interface Names

* Do *not* use "I" prefix for interface names. Use just plain, simple
and relatively short names for interfaces. The user of the interface
should not care whether he is using abstract class or interface (he
should not create it using constructors anyway). Therefore use User, not
IUser.
* It is not required to use able suffix for interfaces, but it helps in
some cases. User is a perfectly good name for an interface as Userable,
Userish or Userlike are quite queer. However, Readable is preferred to
Read, Reading or other strange forms.
* Class names that implement interfaces should somehow be related to the
interface that they implement (or the most important interface in case
of implementing multiple interfaces). For example class implementing
interface User could be UserImpl, UserMock, UserDbImpl or DbBasedUser
(although the last one is not ideal).
* Keep interfaces, abstract classes and other entities that form
cross-component interface in a separate Java package. See below for
naming conventions.

[[getters-and-setters]]
== Getters and Setters

* Getter and setter methods should be used only for simple properties.
The invocation of getter and setter methods should not fail. Getter and
setter methods should not block on a network condition (or any other
condition external to the system).
* Getter and setter methods should not throw checked exceptions, and
they should not throw any exception at all if possible. They in fact may
throw runtime exception, but expect that the system will fail in a
spectacular way if that happens.
* If you need accessor or mutator methods that could fail, give them a
different name. For example retrieveFoo instead of getFoo or registerBar
instead of setBar.

[[best-practice]]
== Best Practice

* code against interfaces, not base implementation nor other
implementation classes. For example define local variable as Map map;
not HashMap map;

[[package-names]]
=== Package Names

* Use org.opendaylight.yang prefix for package names
* Prefix should be followed by component name, e.g.
org.opendaylight.yang.parser
* Complex components may have sub-packages, e.g. or
org.opendaylight.yang.parser.util
* Last segment of the package name (after component name) is used to
distinguish public and private parts of the component. Public interfaces
must be placed in a separate packages. In that case the implementation
should be placed in a separate package as well. E.g.
org.opendaylight.yang.service package contains public service
definition, org.opendaylight.yang.service.impl contains service
implementation, org.opendaylight.yang.service.mock contains mock
implementation of the service. Recommended values are provided in the
following table:

[cols=",,",]
|=======================================================================
|*api* |Public interface (that is exposed outside of component) |

|*spi* |Public interface intended for functionality providers |

|*impl* |Primary component implementation |If there are more than one
implementation intended for production use, do not use this suffix. Use
something that describes the implementation.

|*util* |Utility functionality intended for ease of implementation |

|*mock* |Mock implementation for testing purposes |

|*test* |Unit tests for component |
