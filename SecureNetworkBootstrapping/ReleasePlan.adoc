*Helium (base functionality)*

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Description
|Neighbor discovery |Discover neighbors (Controller to forwarding
element), perform handshake, keep alive. Note: Given that routing on the
SNBI infrastructure will only be supported in Lithium, it means that
Controller and all FEs are assumed to be on the same L2 segment.

|RegistrarBoot a|
SNBI registrar base infrastructure, create interface to work with
different certificate authority (CA), demonstrate integration

with external CA (initial candidate: dogtag)

|RegistrarRegistration a|
Enable forwarding elements to register: Listen for new devices, assign
IDs, obtain domain certificate,

deliver signed certificates to devices

|BootStrap a|
Bootstrap request/response, obtain certificates, initiate secure
communication channel, enable neighbor

discovery (for SNBI proxy mode).

|PortableFoundationFE a|
Reference infrastructure for forwarding element: Reference container
infrastructure based on Docker,

communication/network infrastructure integration (security, etc.)

|SystemTestFramework |Test framework to test SNBI as a solution
(controller and forwarding elements)
|=======================================================================

*Lithium (enhancements)*

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Description
|Encryption |Encryption for communication channel - plugin infra to
leverage existing encryption engines like openSSL

|Routing |Routing over Secure communication channel

|Discovery |Full incremental discovery of forwarding elements

|Certificate Management |Certificate renewal/revocation

|NetworkTopology |Integrate SNBI with topology service of the controller

|Name |Description |Status
|Neighbor discovery a|
(Controller + Forwarding Element) Discover neighbors, create v6
addresses, perform handshake, keep alive. +
* Controller: Southbound plugin, discovery phase - status: build
successful green

* Forwarding element: discovery phase - status: in coding still red

 || Controller Forwarding Element

|RegistrarBoot |(Controller) SNBI registrar base infrastructure, create
interface to work with different certificate authority: Domain name of
the registrar, enable CA to be used by the registrar, plugin to work
with different CAs, crypto APIs to be used by registrar; create
keys/certificates to be signed and get them signed from the CA. +
* Certificate management infra for controller - status: build successful
green || green

|PortableFoundationFE base a|
(Forwarding Element) Reference infrastructure for forwarding element:
Reference container infrastructure based on Docker +
* Publish documentation of portable foundation networking model (status:
published by Jul/4th - green ).

* Base portable foundation docker image (status: will be published by
Jul/11th - yellow )

|Name |Description |Status
|API Freeze |API of the registar defined (this is the only "public" API
of SNBI so far):
https://github.com/opendaylight/snbi/blob/master/southplugin/implementation/src/main/yang/snbi.yang[YANG
model] | green

|RegistrarRegistration |(Controller) Enable forwarding elements to
register: Listen for new devices, assign IDs, obtain domain certificate,
deliver signed certificates to devices: +
Status: Certificate Req/Resp is done boot strap of self is work in
progress. Should be able to meet M4 deadlines. | green

|PortableFoundationFE network |(Forwarding Element)
Communication/network infrastructure integration into reference
container infra. +
Status: Communication/Network Infrastrucure provisioning is done,
YANG/RESTConf for obtaining UDI is pending, but this doesnâ€™t stop from
development of SNBI FE. | green

|Certificate Management |Certificate renewal and revocation integrated
with SNBI registrar. +
Status: This is something we technically cannot do in this phase (this
was an oversight during release planning). Renewal and revocation can be
done only after boot strap of devices which is M5 milestone. Certificate
management will thus move to M5. |n/a

|Neighbor discovery |Catch up from M3. +
Status: We are able to put the basic infrastructure required to run the
SNBI apps in the FE. We are able to send and receive keep alive required
for neighbor discovery (which was mostly the M3 milestone).
Controller-FE discovery still pending - but looks good to get everything
to work for M5. | red |
