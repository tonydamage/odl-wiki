|=======================================================================
|Name |Description
|Neighbor discovery |Discover neighbors (controllers and forwarding
elements), perform handshake, keep alive

|RegistrarBoot a|
SNBI registrar base infrastructure, create interface to work with
different certificate authority (CA), demonstrate integration

with external CA (initial candidate: dogtag)

|RegistrarRegistration a|
Enable forwarding elements to register: Listen for new devices, assign
IDs, obtain domain certificate,

deliver signed certificates to devices

|BootStrap a|
Bootstrap request/response, obtain certificates, initiate secure
communication channel, enable neighbor

discovery (for SNBI proxy mode).

|PortableFoundationFE a|
Reference infrastructure for forwarding element: Reference container
infrastructure based on Docker,

communication/network infrastructure integration (security, etc.)

|SystemTestFramework |Test framework to test SNBI as a solution
(controller and forwarding elements)
