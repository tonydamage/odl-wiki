APPCONTRACK is a OpenDayLight plugin that provides dynamic application
tracking which are running in the hosts of any network and provide
platform to define QOS routing based on policies derived on those
application.

Several new architectures have been developed for supporting multimedia
applications such as digital video and audio. However,
quality-of-service (QoS) routing is an important element that is still
missing from these architectures. SDN provides a huge advantage achieve
QOS routing by considering different constraints and policies. Though
application level routing (application based routing) for achieving
control based on application's properties is still not practical.

Application can track connections between applications situated in
different hosts. Each application pair connected to each other is
refereed as APPCONN.

Using AppConnTrack user could control network element using application
based policy for achieving better QOS on those APPCONN.

Currently it works on Openflow L3 switches.
