* SDNi Aggregator: Northbound SDNi plugin acts as an aggregator for collecting network information such as topology, stats, host etc. This plugin can be evolving as per needs of network data requested to be shared across federated SDN controllers.
* SDNi RestAPI: SDNi REST APIs will be implemented to fetch the aggregated information from the northbound plugin â€“ SDNi aggregator. New SDNi RestAPI will be developed, specific to ODL for supporting SDNi application.
* SDNi Wrapper: SDNi BGP Wrapper will be responsible for the sharing and collecting information to/from federated controllers.
