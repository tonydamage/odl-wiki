==Overview==
This project aims at enabling inter-SDN controller communication by developing SDNi (Software Defined Networking interface) as an application (ODL-SDNi App).

==Architecture==

The following figure depicts the described components:

<br />

* SDNi Aggregator: Northbound SDNi plugin acts as an aggregator for collecting network information such as topology, stats, host etc. This plugin can be evolving as per needs of network data requested to be shared across federated SDN controllers.
* SDNi RestAPI: SDNi REST APIs will be implemented to fetch the aggregated information from the northbound plugin â€“ SDNi aggregator. New SDNi RestAPI will be developed, specific to ODL for supporting SDNi application.
* SDNi Wrapper: SDNi BGP Wrapper will be responsible for the sharing and collecting information to/from federated controllers.

==Getting Started==
=== Prerequisite ===
* A recent Linux distribution - 64bit/4GB RAM
* Java Virtual Machine 1.7 or above
* Apache Maven 3.04 or above
* Mininet VM

=== Initiating ODL-SDNi App ===
Download the following from opendaylight gerrit links
 *  Opendaylight Controller
 *  ODL-SDNi Application
 *  Follow the installation steps of controller in https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Controller:Pulling,_Hacking,_and_Pushing_the_Code_from_the_CLI 
 *  Follow ODL-SDNi User guide to integrate SDNi App in ODL

Note: To check the functionality of ODL-SDNi app, setup should be done in minimum of two machines.
