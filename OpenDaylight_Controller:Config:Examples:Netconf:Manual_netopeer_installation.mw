<pre>

In general you should expect that compiling libnetconf and netopeer in Ubuntu will somewhat bumpy. 

Folks on libnetconf google groups helped a lot. 


10. Install libxml2 (http://xmlsoft.org/)

        sudo apt-cache search libxml2
        sudo apt-get install libxml2

20. Install libxslt
        sudo apt-cache search libxslt
        sudo apt-get install libxslt1.1

	You might find this error when 

	config.status: executing libtool commands
	/bin/rm: cannot remove 'libtoolT': No such file or directory

	Solution:

	edit file <configure> and change this line:

	$RM "$cfgfile"

	to

	$RM -f "$cfgfile"


30. Install libssh2 (www.libssh2.org/)
        sudo apt-cache search libssh2
        sudo apt-get install libssh2-1
        
  It will need openssl or libgcrypt

40. Install libdbus-dev package
	(Important) Do not replace current dbus on Ubuntu by the one in (dbus.freedesktop.org). it is a critical part of the system. I did that and had to recover/reinstall Ubuntu. 
       
        sudo apt-cache search libdbus
	sudo apt-get install libdbus-1-dev

	Always make sure you are installing the correct package

	sudo apt-get update

50. Install doxygen   ( This one's a big one ... took 50 minutes to download on my system )

	sudo apt-get install doxygen

51 Install libcurl-dev

	sudo apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev


60. Pull, Compile and Install libnetconf (code.google.com/p/libnetconf/)

	git clone https://code.google.com/p/libnetconf/

	  At the time of writing:
	  - If you disable notifications (as below) in libnetconf, netopeer will not compile ( and this is good or bad? :-) )

	  $ ./configure --disable-notifications

	The step below is very important otherwise when it is time to test you will hit an access denied issue.

	./configure --with-nacm-recovery-uid=uid

	the uid above is the uid of the person that will use netopeer-cli to test drive the server. In my case it was 1000 (use <id> command in Unix), therefore

	./configure --with-nacm-recovery-uid=1000

	make
	make install

70. Pull netopeer, you will get 4 directories.

	git clone https://code.google.com/p/netopeer/

71 Compiling server-sl

	You will need to install libevent

	sudo apt-get install libevent-dev

	 Compiling Multi-Level server
	  netopeer/server: ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc
	  make
	  make doc (without this step install script fails)
	  sudo make install

80 Compiling cli

	If you get this error:

	checking for readline in -lreadline... no
	configure: error: Missing libreadline

	You might need to install ncurses (http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ncurses/) and readline (http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/readline/). 
        If you already have these installed, you might need the dev version of the libraries.

	sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev
	sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev

	At the time of this writing I could not find a 64-bit readline package so I downloaded and compiled version 6.2

	After each step you should do <sudo ldconfig>

	Finally ./configure LIBS=-lncurses CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include/libxml2

90. Patch your SSHd configuration. 

	The netconf server (single-level, for instance) will be called automagically by sshd when a netconf client connects. In Ubuntu the file is /etc/ssh/sshd_config

	Port 830
	Subsystem netconf /usr/local/bin/netopeer-server-sl

	Restart SSH

	sudo service ssh stop
	sudo service ssh start

	If sshd does not start probably the configuration file has a problem. 

	Try sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -p 22 -D -d -e to see any issues.

100. Access denied issue in server-sl

	Issue:

	netconf> edit running-config
	edit: no such command, type 'help' for more information.
	netconf> edit-config running

	  Type the edit configuration data (close editor by Ctrl-D):
	<toaster xmlns="http://netconfcentral.org/ns/toaster"/>

	NETCONF error: access-denied (application) - creating "toaster" data node is not permitted.

	Solution (David Kupka):

	This is correct behavior as defined in Section 3.7.1 of RFC 6536 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6536#section-3.7.1).

	In libnetconf documentation there is page that should help You configure the Access Control Module: http://libnetconf.googlecode.com/git/doc/doxygen/html/dd/d59/nacm.html

	See previous step on libnetconf and uid
