[[introduction]]
== Introduction

The L2Switch project provides Layer2 switch functionality.

The L2Switch project has the following features/components:

* Packet Handler -- Decodes the packets coming to the controller, and
dispatches them appropriately
* Loop Remover -- Removes loops in the network
* Arp Handler -- Handles the decoded ARP packets
* Address Tracker -- Learns the Addresses (MAC and IP) of entities in
the network
* Host Tracker -- Tracks the locations of hosts in the network
* L2Switch Main -- Installs flows on each switch based on network
traffic
