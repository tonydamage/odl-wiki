=FAQ about configuration subsystem=

== Generic Questions ==

=== There is already JMX. Why do we another system? ===
Java Management Extensions (JMX) provides programmatic access to management data, defining a clear structure on the level of a single object (MBeans). It provides the mechanism to query and set information exposed from these MBeans, too. It is adequate for replacing properties, but it does not treat the JVM container for what it is: a collection of applications working in concert. When the configuration problem is taken to the level of an entire system, there are multiple issues which JMX does not solve:
* The need to validate that a proposed system is semantically valid before an attempt to change is made
* The ability to synchronize modification multiple properties at the same time, such that both occur at the same time
* The ability to express dependencies between applications
* Machine-readable description of layout of configuration data

=== Why YANG? ===
The problem of configuring an device has been tackled in [https://ietf.org IETF] for many years now, initially using [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNMP SNMP] (with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_information_base MIB] as the data definition language). While the protocol has been successful for monitoring devices, it has never gained traction as the unified way of configuring devices. The reasons for this have been [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3535 analyzed] and [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6241 NETCONF] was standardized as the successor protocol. NETCONF provides the abstractions to deal with configuration validation and relies on [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6020 YANG] as its data modeling language. The configuration subsystem is designed to completely align with NETCONF such that it can be used as the native transport with minimal translation.
