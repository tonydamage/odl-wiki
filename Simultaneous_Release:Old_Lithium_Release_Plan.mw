== Introduction == 

This is a Simultaneous Release Plan for OpenDaylight.  
Projects may choose to participate or not based upon their readiness and desire to join the Simultaneous Release.
This plan is structured as laid out in the  [http://www.opendaylight.org/project-lifecycle-releases Project Lifecycle]

== Requirements for Participation ==

# Planning
## Projects must declare their intent to participate in the Simultaneous Release by M1.
## Participating projects must publish a candidate Release Plan by M1 and declare their Release Plan by M2
### Participating project Release Plans must contain Milestones that minimally line up with the Simultaneous Release Plan Milestones
# Modularity
## Modules that are not intended to interface with the controller via REST/other rpc mechanism must be OSGI bundles
## OSGI bundles should be reasonably granular
# Quality
## No later than M4, each project must have a Jenkins Job which rebuilds and retests to an appropriate level when a project it depends on publishes new artifacts ('''Continuous Integration Test Start''')
## No later than M2 as part of the Gerrit/Jenkins merge process participating projects must push their binary artifacts to the Nexus repo.
# Code Hygiene
## No uses of System.out.println in non testcase code.
## No dependencies on 3rd party (non-ODL) snapshot versions

== Assumptions, Aspirations and Intentions ==

Assumption - The Helium Release will occurr as planned on September 29th, 2014 <br>

Add overall goals/asperations for the Lithium Release here as we encounter them during the execution of the Helium release.

== Milestones, Release Candidates, and Service Releases ==

Milestones are spaced roughly 4 weeks apart taking into account significant holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas (are there others that should impact the schedule?)

Release Candidates (RC) are spaced 1 week apart

Service Releases are roughly 6 weeks and 12 weeks after the Formal Lithium Release.

This is a DRAFT SCHEDULE.  This is a DRAFT SCHEDULE.  This is a DRAFT SCHEDULE.

Please note that the TSC reserves the right to allow projects to enter the Simultaneous Release for a reasonable period of time after the M1 date. 

For example, the TSC may allow additional time if a project is delayed by the IPR Review process.

Please also note that projects that may be splitting into logical parts may have those logical parts join the Simultaneous Release at any point prior to M3 provided
their Release Plans are apportioned between the projects they split into.

== Participating Projects ==
* TBD
Participating projects should list themselves here prior to M1, with a link to their Project wiki page and their Release Plan.

== Communication Channels == 

=== Mailing List ===

discuss@lists.opendaylight.org is the formal channel for communication about the Simultaneous Release.

=== Per project Simultaneous Release Contact ===

Each project participating in the Simultaneous Release should designate a committer to be the contact for that project for that Simultaneous Release

=== Cross Project Milestone and Release Candidate Reporting ===

Negative status needs to be reported promptly.  If a project is under threat of, or does miss an element on its Release Plan, it should report that as soon as it becomes aware.

Positive Status need to be reported by each project at each Milestone Reporting status for that Milestone or Release Candidate.  Information would include things like pointers to 
continuous integration Jenkins Jobs, etc.

It is the responsibility of each projects Simultaneous Release Contact to report both positive and negative statuses.

=== Simultaneous Release Developer Meetings ===

One week prior to each Milestone or Release Candidate starting at M1, an IRC meeting for developer interested in the Simultaneous Release should be organized for real time coordination
and checkin.  The Simultaneous Release Contact for each project (or their delegate) should minimally be in attendance.

=== Bugs ===

Bugs should be filed in [https://bugs.opendaylight.org/ Bugzilla]

== Service Release Expectations == 

Please see [[Lithium Service Release Expectations]] for information about branch naming, patch criteria, service release criteria.

== Addendum ==
