== Description ==

At the moment the topic/performance/async branch works in that it will run and connect to switches, but a pingall in mininet results in a slew of exceptions and the pings don't actually get through.

== Deliverables ==

# A commit or series of commits that fixes the exceptions in the topic/performance/async branch during normal operation.

== Pointers ==

* The documentation about how to get the simple forwarding application up and running: [[OpenDaylight Controller:Installation#Using_the_Simple_Forwarding_Application|Simple Forwarding Application]]
* I recommend first getting it to work correctly on the master branch and then switching to the topic/performance/async branch ot see the difference.

== Notes: ==

== Mentor ==
