OpenDaylight has started a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust[GPG
Web of Trust] (WoT). The purpose of this WoT is to create a basis for
internal checks and balances on code that is committed to OpenDaylight,
maturity of projects, and eventually the signing of artifacts as well.

We are still working out the best way to publish information on this web

Google map. The map description explains the different coloration
choices and meanings. I suggest for privacy reasons that you not pin
your location directly to your home or work but to a location near where
you're normally willing to meet folks to do a face to face signing.
