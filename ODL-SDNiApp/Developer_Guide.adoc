[[overview]]
== Overview

This project aims at enabling inter-SDN controller communication by
developing SDNi (Software Defined Networking interface) as an
application (ODL-SDNi App).

[[architecture]]
== Architecture

The following figure depicts the described components:
File:Architecture.PNG[500px |none] +

* SDNi Aggregator: Northbound SDNi plugin acts as an aggregator for
collecting network information such as topology, stats, host etc. This
plugin can be evolving as per needs of network data requested to be
shared across federated SDN controllers.
* SDNi RestAPI: SDNi REST APIs will be implemented to fetch the
aggregated information from the northbound plugin – SDNi aggregator. New
SDNi RestAPI will be developed, specific to ODL for supporting SDNi
application.
* SDNi Wrapper: SDNi BGP Wrapper will be responsible for the sharing and
collecting information to/from federated controllers.

[[getting-started]]
== Getting Started

[[prerequisite]]
=== Prerequisite

* A recent Linux distribution - 64bit/4GB RAM
* Java Virtual Machine 1.7 or above
* Apache Maven 3.04 or above
* Mininet VM

[[initiating-odl-sdni-app]]
=== Initiating ODL-SDNi App

Download the following from opendaylight gerrit links

* Opendaylight Controller
* ODL-SDNi Application

Follow the installation steps of controller in
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Controller:Pulling,_Hacking,_and_Pushing_the_Code_from_the_CLI

Follow ODL-SDNi User guide(ODL-SDNiApp:User_Guide[User Guide])to
integrate SDNi App in ODL Note: To check the functionality of ODL-SDNi
app, setup should be done in minimum of two machines.

[[how-to-start-and-run]]
=== How to start and run

* ODL-SDNi setup is ready, run the controller using ./run.sh with
supernodes command.

Refer
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Controller:Clustering:HowTo
to run the controllers in cluster mode.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
./run.sh -Dsupernodes=<supernodesIP1>[:<supernodesIP2>]..[:<supernodesIPN>]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Mininet script to be written for creating the topology of the
clustered controllers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
net=Mininet(controller = RemoteController, switch = OVSKernelSwitch , host=CPULimitedHost, link=TCLink)
c1 = net.addController('c1', controller=RemoteController, ip="IPaddress of controller1", port=6633)
c2 = net.addController('c2', controller=RemoteController, ip="IPaddress of controller2", port=6643)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: See TroubleShooting of User Guide for any issue in running the
mininet. ODL-SDNiApp:User_Guide[User Guide]

* Use the ping command to see the packet forwarded between the switches
of clustered controllers.

[[developers-guide-for-sdniaggregator]]
== Developer’s Guide for SDNiAggregator

SDNiAggregator connects with the Base Network Service Functions of the
controller. Currently it is querying topology manager, switch manager,
host tracker and statistics manager for creating SDNi network
capability.

SDNiAggregator is customized to retrieve the host controller’s details,
while running the controller in cluster mode. Rest of the northbound
APIs of controller will retrieve the entire topology information of all
the connected controllers.

Diagrammatic Representation is as below:

 The SDNiAggregator creates a topology structure.This structure is
populated by the various network funtions as shown in the diagram above.

[[developers-guide-for-sdnirestapi]]
== Developer’s Guide for SDNiRestAPI

ODL-SDNi rest api query SDNiAggregator to get the required information.

[[developers-guide-for-sdniwrapper]]
== Developer’s Guide for SDNiWrapper

The SDNiWrapper diagrammatic representation is as below

image:SDNiWrapper.png[SDNiWrapper.png,title="SDNiWrapper.png"]

SDNiWrapper is an extension of ODL-BGPCEP where SDNi topology data is
exchange along with the Update NLRI message. Refer
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-idr-ls-distribution-04 for more
information on NLRI

SDNiWrapper gets the controller’s network capabilities through SDNi REST
API and serialize it in Update NLRI message. This NLRI message will get
exchange between the clustered controllers through BGP-UPDATE message.
Similarly peer controller’s UPDATE message is received and unpacked then
format to SDNi Network capability data, which will be stored for further
purpose.

Please refer User Guide(ODL-SDNiApp:User_Guide[User Guide]) for running
and integration.
