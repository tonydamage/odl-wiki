SNBI intends to provide a secure channel that can be used by other
applications to securely connect to various devices.

Following is the use case on a controller that can be envisioned with
such a secure channel.

* If SNBI is active and running in the controller, other apps can safely
assume that there exists a secure IP reachability to various devices in
the network.

Based on the above desired use case following approaches are possible.

|=======================================================================
|Model |Overview |Access to Secure Channel |Requirements |Caviots
|*App Layer Registrar Tunnel* a|
| Create a UDP tunnel that is terminated in the registrar.

* The message is first encapsulated with a transport layer header (UDP)
with SNBI Src/Dst Ports.
* The UDP encapsulated message is then encapsulated with an IP header
with the desired Src/Dst IP.
* The packet thus derived is then sent over a socket to the next hop
neighbour.
* The other end of the socket is then terminated into an Userland
program which again routes the packet based on the IP header available.

*Access thru Message delivering APIs.*

* No choice of a desire transport.
* Cannot support multiple tunnels to different neighbours.
* We can facilitate the adoption by exposing such a service thru
existing message passing infrastructure (like Rabbit MQ) libraries.
* This would also mean that both the producers and consumers use the
Rabbit MQ infrastructure.

*Creation of per APP secure connection*

* SNBI could provide APIs to get the certificate generated for a
particular device/IP.
* Once the certificate is obtained together with the host device
certificate, each APP could establish a secure connection of a transport
of their choice to the devices.

*Access thru Message delivering APIs.*

* Provide message delivering APIs.
* Make required changes to Rabbit MQ libraries.

*Creation of per APP secure connection.*

* Provide APIs to obtain certificates for a given device ULA IP.

*Access thru Message delivering APIs.*

* It would be difficult to convince every APP to adapt to a message
delivery infrastructure.
* The APPS cannot create a transport of their choice.

a|
*Creation of per APP secure connection*

* per-hop secure tunnels are used only for SNBI traffic.

|=======================================================================

|*Proxy model* a|

[cols="",]
|=======================================================================

*Co Hosted Proxy Forwarding Element*

* A forwarding Element is hosted in the controller host.
* The forwarding Element and the Controller interact over a "socket" or
use some kind of RPC mechanism (thrift , google protocol buffers).
* The entire SNBI protocol stack is implemented in the Forwarding
element, only the registrar feature is implemented in the controller.
* Everything is the same, just that the registrar is no longer within
the forwarding element but outside.
* The forwarding element takes care of discovering neighbours, creating
loopback interface, assigning IP address, and establishing IPSEC/GRE
tunnel.
* The routing protocol running in the forwarding element takes care of
forwarding the packet to the appropriate destination over the tunnels.
* SNBI topology management is yet another RPC call to the Forwarding
Element. The topology protocol as such doesn't run in the controller.
* Every SNBI feature that we develop could be extended to the controller
through the RPC.

a|
*Remote Hosted Proxy Forwarding Element*

* The forwarding element is remotely hosted in another host.
* The interaction between the controller and the Forwarding element is
still over RPC.
* We might have to go thru a discovery phase, wherein the controller
discovers the device and bootstraps it to proxy on its behalf.
* Or we give explicitly the IP address of the host which would act as a
proxy. This IP address need not necessarily be the ULA address which
could be generated once the device is bootstrapped.
* IP address of the controller host is manually assigned.
* There is no security assumption between the controller host and the
proxy host, its left to the administrator to make sure there is one.
* The administrator configures the default route for all SNBI generated
ULA address to be the proxy host.
* A per hop secure tunnel is questionable.

*Co Hosted Proxy Forwarding Element*

* Other apps (within/outside the controller) assume that there is secure
IP reachability.

a|
*Remote Hosted Proxy Forwarding Element*

* The apps assume that there is IP reachability.
* But apps don't make any assumption regarding the security of the
network layer.

|=======================================================================

 a|
|

* Some kind of RPC infrastructure needs to be integrated with the
existing code.
* Administrator needs to provide the IP address of the proxy host, it
could be localhost or some remote host.
* If its remote host, its upto the administrator to make sure that there
exists an IP reachability between the controller host and the proxy
host.
* Its upto the administrator to create a secure SSL connection to the
proxy Forwarding element either remote or local.

*Co Hosted Proxy Forwarding Element*

* Require Root/sudo permission to program the underlying network stack.

a|
*Remote Hosted Proxy Forwarding Element*

* The Apps cannot leverage the IP security that SNBI offers, only the IP
reachability that SNBI offers.
* Require some degree of human intervention.
* Assumes that there is some degree of IP reachability at least to the
proxy host.
