== Communication Channels ==

Communication is part of the lifeblood of any open source project and there are several different ways we communicate in OpenDaylight.

The first and possibly the most useful to many folks is [[IRC]] the second and equally important is [[https://lists.opendaylight.org mailing lists]]. You will find a large number of lists available but we're also working on reducing the number and merging lists.

=== Mailing list Topics ===

The merge of lists is done via the built in [[http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/mailman-member/node29.html topics]] feature of [[http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/index.html GNU Mailman]].

The following lists have topics applied to them:

* [[https://lists.opendaylight.org/mailman/listinfo/dev dev]]
* [[https://lists.opendaylight.org/mailman/listinfo/discuss discuss]]
* [[https://lists.opendaylight.org/mailman/listinfo/jenkins jenkins]]

The following projects do not have dedicated mailing lists in the same fashion that older projects do as such, they utilize mailing lists topics as the only way of segregating their list traffic:

* [[OpenDaylight_Tookit:Main | OpenDaylight Toolkit]]
* [[PacketCablePCMM:Main | PacketCable PCMM]]

By default when you join one of those lists you will receive **all** topics.

To only receive the topics which you want you will need to log into your management interface for the given list. If you did not specifically set a password when you joined the list one will have been created and mailed to you. By default it is resent on the first day of each month. You may access the subscription management interface by going to the subscription page for the given list and entering the email address that you subscribed with into the very bottom entry box on the page next to the button entitled 'Unsubscribe or edit options'.

On the next page enter your list specific password and press the 'Log in' button.

Scroll down to the section which asks the question "Which topic categories would you like to subscribe to?" and select the topics that you want to monitor. You probably also want to set the following question "Do you want to receive messages that do not match any topic filter" to yes (at least until you know for certain that you don't want non-topic mail). Scroll down and press the 'Submit my changes' button.

=== Gerrit and Bugzilla mail ===

With the attempt to decrease and combine our mailing lists comes the fact that new projects do not get [[https://git.opendaylight.org Gerrit (git)]] lists and neither do [[https://bugs.opendaylight.org Bugzilla]] projects.

Please see the following pages on ways to get and follow mail from these systems:

* [[Communication:Gerrit | Gerrit change mail]]
* [[Communication:Bugzilla | Following Bugzilla queues]]
