With the release of hydrogen, it is necessary that all project create a stable/hydrogen branch to support bug fixes in both the master branch and any stable branch.  This page walks the reader through how to do this, using the gerrit and jenkins web interfaces and the OpenDOVE project as a sample.

===Step 1: Create branch in Gerrit===

* In Gerrit, select Projects/List
* Select your project and then Branches

*Commit and then push to refs/for/stable/hydrogen

===Step 3: Reconfigure Jenkins Merge Job for Master Only===

Today's Jenkins *-merge job are set up to run regardless of the branch that is merged to.  This has the side effect of making archived artifcats (e.g. enunciated APIs and javadocs) ephermeal in that as development continues, the apis of a stable branch can be lost.  To avoid this, we reconfigure the existing Jenkin's merge job to work (and trigger from) the master branch only.

*Change the branch to build from origin/$GERRIT_BRANCH to origin/master
