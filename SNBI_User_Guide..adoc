[[introduction]]
== Introduction

The wiki contains information regarding using SNBI. The user guide could
be broken up in two pieces,

* Setting up SNBI in controller.
* Setting up SNBI in the forwarding Element.

A high level overview of the interaction between the two modules is as
depicted below. Also it is to be noted, that bootstrapping of only
directed connected devices on the same LAN is possible, we will further
this functionality to support bootstrapping multiple hop devices in the
next releases.

A details architecture overview and protocol details is available
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/SNBI_Architecture_and_Design[here.]

[[prerequisite]]
== Prerequisite

* 64bit Ubunutu 14.04 LTS
** Especially for Docker, its required that we deploy docker version
greater than 1.0 on a 14.04 Ubuntu.
* 4GB RAM
* 4GB of Hard disk space, sufficient enough to store certificates.
* Java Virtual Machine 1.7 or above
* Apache Maven 3.04 or above

SNBI is included in all the release vehicles except for MINIMAL feature
set. Refer
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Simultaneous_Release:Helium_Release_Plan#Proposed_Release_Vehicles[here]
to the Helium proposed release vehicles and the features included in
each release vehicle.

[[karaf-based-distribution-installation]]
=== Karaf Based Distribution Installation

* Download the karaf based distribution of desire from the download page
http://www.opendaylight.org/software/downloads[here].
* Once downloaded unzip the package if required and get into the karaf
binary folder (bin) and run the karaf executable.

For Example:

-------------------------------------------
cd distribution-karaf-0.2.0-Helium-RC0/bin/
./karaf
-------------------------------------------

[[installing-snbi-feature-and-relevant-modules.]]
=== Installing SNBI feature and relevant modules.

* Once karaf is run, install the snbi feature module.
* It is also required that RESTConf module is installed to use RESTConf
APIs.
* It may be desired to install mdsal-apidocs module for easy access to
documentation.
* Once installed verify if the features are indeed installed, by listing
the features installed.

---------------------------------
feature:install odl-restconf
feature:install odl-mdsal-apidocs
feature:install odl-snbi-all
feature:list -i
---------------------------------

* Once the required features are installed, use REST APIs documented and
accessible using the swagger interface to push the domain and white list
information.
** It might be of help to refer to
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Controller:MD-SAL:Restconf_API_Explorer[here],
for more information on how to use swagger based interface to access
RESTful APIs.
* After the required Domain and white list information is pushed to the
controller, start snbi for that domain. More useful Karaf commands can
be found
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/CrossProject:Integration_Group:karaf[here].

------------------------
snbi:start <domain-name>
------------------------

[[setting-up-snbi-on-forwarding-elements]]
== Setting Up SNBI on Forwarding Elements

In the SNBI topology, the Portable Foundations run on Ubuntu Linux
servers, running Docker 1.0.0 or later version. We rely on 3 files from
the SNBI repository to run a Portable Foundation Container: CPA
(Container Provisioning Agent), UDI_DB.json (A UDI configuration
database), host_pf_server.py (a RESTconf server implementation). Using
the CPA script to start, monitor and login to a portable foundation is
easier. But if you need to customize the way things are set up, you can
do it the hard way, as described
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Page#Steps_to_Start_a_SNBI_Portable_Foundation_Container_the_Hard_Way[here].

[[preparation-for-running-portable-foundations]]
== Preparation for Running Portable Foundations

* Install docker. Docker installation instruction is available at,

`     `http://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/[`http://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/`]

* We need docker v1.0.0 or above. At the time of this writing docker
v1.1.2 is the latest release.

To confirm the version of docker installed,

`    % sudo docker -v` +
`    Docker version 1.0.0, build 63fe64c`

* Check out SNBI source code

`  git clone `https://[`https://`]`@git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/p/snbi.git` +
`  cd snbi/portablefoundation/infra/`

* There are potentially 3 portable foundations in use. Their names are
SNBI_PF0, SNBI_PF1, SNBI_CTRL. Their configuration parameters associated
with the local host are stored in file UDI_DB.json. At the time of this
writing (Sept 2014), only the Universal Device Identifier (UDI) is
associated with a portable foundation. New portable foundations can be
added to the host after their local configurations are added into the
UDI_DB.json file.

* Start the server on the host.

`  % cpa rest_start`

`  The server will be listening to requests on `http://localhost:8080[`http://localhost:8080`]`.`

* Start SNBI_PF0

`  % cpa pf_start SNBI_PF0 21000`

* Start SNBI_PF1

`  % cpa pf_start SNBI_PF1 21001`

* Check all running portable foundations

`  % cpa list`

* Login to SNBI_PF0

`  % cpa login SNBI_PF0`

* Stop SNBI_PF0

`  % cpa pf_stop SNBI_PF0`

* Kill SNBI_PF0 and free all resources.

`  % cpa pf_kill SNBI_PF0`

[[device-bootstrap]]
== Device Bootstrap

Once the docker environment is up and running, the device should be able
to discover each other and if the UDI of the device is a valid device
for a give domain, the device should be bootstrapped with a domain
certificate. Currently the certificate information is not accessible to
the end user but this will be used to setup secure channel to other
connected devices in subsequent releases.
