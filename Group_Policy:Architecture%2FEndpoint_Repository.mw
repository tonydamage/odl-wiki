The endpoint repository is responsible for storing metadata about endpoints, including how they are mapped into endpoint groups.  Information about endpoints can be added to the repository either by a central orchestration system or by a renderer that performs discovery to learn about new endpoints.  In either case, the semantics of how an endpoint is mapped to an endpoint group are not defined here; the system that sets up the information in the endpoint repository must have its own method for assigning endpoints to endpoint groups.
