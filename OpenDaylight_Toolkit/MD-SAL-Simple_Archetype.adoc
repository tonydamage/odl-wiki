= Introduction

A maven archetype
(http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html)
is essentially a maven project template. We have created an MD-SAL
archetype (called MD-SAL-App-Simple) which demonstrates how to use some
of the MD-SAL services and features. It is intended to give developers a
head start in developing applications and can allow the majority of the
developers to ignore some of the more complex MD-SAL features during
their initial hacking.

More complex uses of the archetype enable developers to quickly auto
generate more complex yang files based on user provided fields.

[[md-sal-app-simple-usage---simple-use]]
= MD-SAL-App-Simple Usage - Simple Use

The following section talks you through how to use the MD-SAL-App-Simple
archetype to get started on creating a simple MD-SAL application.

[[one-time-setup]]
== ONE TIME SETUP

Note: We are working to resolve issues where the maven archetype can not
be found. If you run the below maven commend but get prompted with a
list of repository where you can go and find the archetype, then you
need to run the follow commands to do a onetime download and compiling
of the archetype source code and build it. There is an issue with
certificates that is preventing us from referencing the repository
directly.

Here is the list of commands, in a single line form, to download, and
build the toolkit project:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
git clone https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/p/toolkit.git && cd toolkit && mvn clean install -D skipTests
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you have run this command once you will not have to run it again
(until you want to get an update to the archetype). This wiki will be
updated once the issue is resolved.

[[run-the-maven-archetype]]
== Run the Maven Archetype

1.  cd to the folder where you want to place your MD-SAL application.
This archetype will generate a parent bundle and 4 child bundles.
* _Note: Running this archetype under the opendaylight controller
project hive does not currently work. Use a "fresh" directory not nested
under the main project._
2.  Run the following mvn command:
+
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.opendaylight.toolkit  -DarchetypeArtifactId=md-sal-app-simple 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* _This command starts the maven archetype generating in an interactive
mode, during which you will be prompted for the additional fields:_
** *groupId*: The group id will become the in the maven project.
Typically this is a high level grouping, starting with the company or
organization, such as 'org.opendaylight.controller'
** *artifactId*: The artifact ID will become the in the maven project.
This will be the prefix for the folder names and all sub-maven project.
Typically this describes the functionality or group project, such as
"toaster-sample" etc.
** *version*: The version of this artifact. You can hit enter to accept
the default of "1.0=SNAPSHOT" or enter your own version.
** *package*: Defines the prefix for all packages. This defaults to a
package created from the group id.
** *modelFields*: This is a property which you define fields when using
the MD-SAL archetype in a more advanced way. See below for advanced
options. For now, simple accept the defaults.

The maven archetype generation should now have completed, resulting in
the following folder structure:

* ** consumer
** generate
** model
** provider
** web
** features

Before we discuss what each of these bundles provides, continue to the
next section to finish the template generation.

[[finish-generation---run-the-generator]]
== Finish Generation - Run the 'Generator'

Because maven archetypes are extremely limited in their capabilities,we
need to run one more step to generate the remainder of the template code
which we need for our sample application. To do this we need to make use
of the "generate" folder which was created in the previous step.

1.  cd into the /generate project.
2.  Run 'mvn clean install -Dgen' +
*This will copy a number of additional files to the remaining four
projects and finishes the initialization.*
3.  cd up one directory (i.e. 'cd ..'). And now run a complete build
(i.e. 'mvn clean install'). You should see that the parent project
(named after your artifact id), and four child projects (consumer,
model, provider, and web) all compile successfully.
4.  Delete the generate folder as it is no longer needed.

You now have a fully functional MD-SAL application template which
provides a number of capabilities. Read on for more information about
what each project provides a template for, and which you can discard.

At this point you can import your projects into eclipse or other IDE's
as you desire (see
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/GettingStarted:_Eclipse).

[[what-does-the-md-sal-archetype-provide-for-us]]
= What does the MD-SAL Archetype Provide for us?

The MD-SAL Archetype provides demo projects for the following services:

* A Karaf features directory. This provides a list of sample features to
enable provider, consumer and web.
* A yang model. This project provides a sample yang file with some
minimal sample yang contents, including an RPC call.
** The only manually modified code in this project is generally the yang
file which models your service. The project also contains all of the
auto-generated java files that are created for your model.
* A provider application. This project provides a sample implementation
of the RPC service which is defined in the yang file stored in the model
project.
* A consumer application. This demonstrates how you can write a bundle
which consumes one or more services through the MD-SAL (but doesn't
provide any implementations of a service defined in a yang file etc).
** You may want to use this template if you have business intelligence
which needs to use the RPC implementation defined in the provider, BUT
is logically a separate piece of functionality. If you do not want to
use this bundle, see below "How to Remove Unneeded Projects".
* A web application. This project provides a sample _custom_ rest
interface. This rest interface is in addition to the rest interfaces
exposed via RESTConf automatically.
** It is encouraged that you use the RESTConf web services whenever
possible for interactions with your application, as opposed to using
your own REST implementation.
** You do NOT need this bundle to use the RESTConf web services.

Most applications only need the model and the provider bundles.

= Additional Generation Parameters

[[naming-your-application-optional]]
== Naming your Application (optional)

By default the word "Task" is used to prefix your yang files and thus is
used in your generated package names, java interfaces etc. To change
this prefix, simply add the following option to the maven command line:

`
  -DappName=<appNamePrefix>
`

For example:

`
  mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.opendaylight.toolkit  -DarchetypeArtifactId=md-sal-app-simple -DappName=Toaster
`

[[specify-artifact-id-and-group-id-on-the-command-line-optional]]
== Specify Artifact ID and Group ID on the Command Line (optional)

You can also specify the desired group ID and artifact ID on the command
line instead of interacting with maven archetype generator. To do this,
simply add these fields to the archetype command:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
           -DgroupId=<< Any group Id such as org.opendaylight.controller>>
           -DartifactId=<<Any app name such as mdSalExample>>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example, the full command might be:

`
   mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.opendaylight.toolkit  -DarchetypeArtifactId=md-sal-app-simple -DappName=Toaster  -DgroupId=org.opendaylight.controller -DartifactId="mdSalExample"
`

[[quick-start-read-me]]
== Quick Start Read Me

In ddition to code, the maven archetype also generates a READ_ME file.
You can optionally follow the quick start steps in the generated READ_ME
file. You can obtain the same information in this wiki as in the READ
ME, however the wiki has more details.

Look for the "Archetype_Next_Steps.README" text file in the generated
code.

[[how-to-remove-unneeded-projects]]
= How to Remove Unneeded Projects

To remove unneeded projects, you delete the project (i.e. 'rm -rf web'
or 'i.e. rm-rf consumer') and then modify the pom.xml file in the root
folder (which is the same name as your artifact) and remove the unneeded
projects from the "" section. Then open features.xml file present in
features/src/main/resources directory. Remove the feature of project
that you are removing. Like web or consumer feature. Then run a 'mvn
clean install' to verify that all projects still build.

_Note, the model and provider projects require the model project to
build correctly._

If you only want to stop building your dependent projects, but _keep_
the sample code for future use, just remove the project name from the
module section in the root pom.xml file.

[[how-to-deploy-your-feature]]
= How to Deploy your feature

These steps outline how to manually deploy your application feature into
the controller.

1.  Go to your project directory. cd .
2.  Run mvn clean install to build your application.
3.  Locate your ODL distribution. The distribution for the core
controller is found under the controller git repository (after running a
mvn clean install from the controller root). The path is
controller/opendaylight/distribution/opendaylight-karaf/target/assembly/bin.
4.  Start karaf via command ./karaf.
5.  Add your feature repo in the karaf. This can be done in following
way, where , and are what you supplied before -

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    feature:repo-add mvn:<groupId>/features-<artifactId>/<version>/xml/features
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An example of above command would be like below -

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    feature:repo-add mvn:org.opendaylight.controller/features-mdSalExample/1.0-SNAPSHOT/xml/features
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Once feature repo is added, install the feature on karaf console via
command such as

--------------------------------
    feature:install odl-task-web
--------------------------------

If you have picked a different appName, then feature name will be
odl--web etc.

1.  You should see messages similar to the following being printed:

Note: Below our "app-name" is "Task" (yours by default is the same)- you
can see that we use that name as the prefix for classes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2014-07-02 05:16:08.258 EDT [config-pusher] INFO  o.o.c.c.y.c.t.i.TaskProviderModule - TaskProvider (instance org.opendaylight.controller.config.yang.config.task_provider.impl.TaskProviderModule$1CloseResources@11a15a0) initialized.
2014-07-02 05:16:08.305 EDT [config-pusher] INFO  o.o.c.c.y.c.t.i.TaskConsumerModule - TaskConsumerService (instance org.opendaylight.controller.config.yang.config.task_consumer.impl.TaskConsumerModule$1AutoCloseableService@56e83e5e) initialized.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you see these info messages printed on the Karaf log then you have
successfully deployed your bundles!

[[tips-for-editing-the-template-code]]
= Tips for Editing the Template Code

A few tips to remember when you start to edit the template code:

* Build often! Your projects should build quickly (especially if you run
the build command from the generate root project). Building often will
allow you to catch errors quickly.
* There are a number of auto-generated java classes that are created
from your yang model. After you modify the model yang file you will want
to recompile, which may result in compile errors in the provider or
consumer bundles who use that code. Consider commenting the example code
out until things compile again.
* Remove the projects you don't think you need - this will reduce the
time you may be tracing down code generation issues.
* A .gitignore file is created which ignores files that should not be
checked in. If you are not using git make sure you set up the proper
ignore files for your source control.

[[advanced-usage-of-the-md-sal-app-simple-archetype]]
= Advanced Usage of the MD-SAL-App-Simple Archetype

The advanced features of the MD-SAL-App-Simple archetype provides better
auto generation of a yang file for you instead of you having to manually
edit the file. To do this you will make use of the "modelProperties"
field which we skipped (or rather accepted the defaults) before.

When prompted during the interactive mode, or optionally using the
'-DmodelFields' flag on the command line, you can provide a JSON
formatted list of fields that you want included in your yang file.

*`TODO:` `We` `need` `more` `information` `and` `examples` `on` `how`
`this` `works` `and` `what` `fields` `we` `can` `add.`*

[[behind-the-scenes-how-archetype-works]]
== Behind the Scenes: How Archetype Works

Maven archetype is very limited when it comes to building dynamic
applications. md-sal-simple-archetype provides scaffold to build an
md-sal based application. It will generate a yang model, a service
producer, a service consumer for other OSGi applications and a web based
consumer that uses RESTConf APIs. +
 Once you create your application using md-sal-simple-archetype, use
*mvn clean install -Dgen* just once; it activates the maven profile to
generate dynamic code for you. It triggers one java class,
CodeGenerator.class, present under generate folder. That CodeGenerator
class use velocity templates to generate files under model, provider,
consumer, web and configuration files. It generates all yang model, java
service and config subsystem files for your application, based on the
name of application. +
 You can remove the generate projects from your application's directory
structure and its reference in the parent pom, once you create the
initial working application and start making your own changes.
