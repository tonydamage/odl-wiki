== Meeting Summary

Attendees: Sharon, Basheer, YuLing, Mohnish, and Rajesh.

* Project status report
** Sharon talked about Data Collection POC ideas and status.
** YuLing reported that Project Creation/Checklist task is completed.
* Clustering Discussion
** We discussed about clustering solutions and reached the following
conclusion:
*** MD-SAL clustering and HBase clustering are two different level of
clustering and should not mingle together to cause confusions.
*** In Lithium, we will not try to leverage MD-SAL clustering to achieve
database level clustering capabilities. Therefore, we will suggest the
installation of only one HBase single node instance in MD-SAL clustering
scenario and there will be no HA or clustering support on persistence
data store level.
*** Beyond Lithium, the persistence data store level HA and clustering
will be achieved by HBase clustering support in TSDR.
