Service Function Chaining provides the ability to define an ordered list of a network services (e.g. firewalls, load balancers).  These service are then "stitched" together in the network to create a service chain.  This project provides the infrastructure (chaining logic, APIs) needed for ODL to provision a service chain in the network and an end-user application for defining such chains.


This project includes the following documents:

== SFC TODO ==

* Finish the RPC interface (SfcProviderRPC). Today it is limited in scope and which elements it exercises 
* Integrate the config file bootstrap so the code is fully self healing (High Priority)
* Iron out the JSON object to provision a SFF (see point below). This will most likely be similar to SFF Yang model. 
* ''(Done)'' Implement REST API to communicate southbound with switch front-end. This API will send the JSON object to the server that will communicate with switches 
* Integrate with dlux UI 
* ''(Done)'' Integrate the distribution POMs 
* At some point move to the new DataListener APIs. Hopefully somebody else will weed out the  bugs. 
* Change the Yang models to use  leafrefs, idenityrefs and others when we are confident it will not cause Data Deserialization errors. 
* Harden the code 
* SfcProvider*API classes need to be changed to Callable (maybe, need to test with new DataBroker service) 
* Integrate with LISP service 
* Python regression tests
* ''(Done)'' Fix windows line terminators
* Logback configuration for tracing messages
* SFF should be decoupled from path ID
