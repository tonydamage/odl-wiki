== CURRENT TESTS ==

=== MapRegister === 
Send a MapRegister to the mapping service, wait for the MapNotify, and check it is correct.

=== MapRegister and MapRequest === 
Send a MapRegister to the mapping service, wait for the MapNotify , and check it is correct, 
and then send a MapRequest with the EID which was registered and wait for the MapReply, and check that we got The RLOC we registered.

=== MapRequest before MapRegister ===
Send a MapRequest, make sure that the MapReply has no RLOCs, send a MapRegister for that EID, 
send the MapRequest again and make sure that this time the MapReply contains the RLOC we registerd. 

== TO DO ==

=== EID prefix lookups ===
Register EIDs with different masks, and check that requests return prefix matches.

=== Password prefix configurations ===
Configure different passwords for different prefixes, and make sure that registers work only with their right password.

=== Map Register and Map Request northbound ===
Add a mapping using the northbound interface, retrieve that mapping using the northbound interface, check that both mappings are equal.

=== Map Register northbound and Map Request southbound ===
Add a mapping using the northbound interface, send a Map Request to the southbound and get the Map Reply, check that both mappings are equal.

=== Map Register southbound and Map Request northbound ===
Send a Map Register over the southbound interface, retrieve the mapping using the northbound interface, check that both mappings are equal.
