'''Wiki and Continuous Evolution''' – Documentation should be published to http://wiki.OpenDaylight.org/ so any contributor can improve it

'''Versioning''' – We want the documentation to continue to improve even after the bits are released but we need to make sure readers understand what is available in various releases:
* If a feature will only be available in the next release indicate as “Coming in Helium”
* If a feature is deprecated in a future release, indicate as “Deprecated in Helium”

'''Language''' - The OpenDaylight project uses English as its primary language but contributors are encouraged to translate into other languages.  If content is available in other languages, consider providing hyperlinks at the top of the section  (ex: “English | Hebrew | Spanish”)

'''Platforms''' – Where possible, there should be a single set of documentation for all platforms.  If there is variance, this should be described in parallel.  For example:
* On Linux, …
* On MacOS, …
* On Windows, …

'''Screenshots''' – When possible, screenshots should vary (ex: Chrome on MacOS, Firefox on Windows, etc.)
