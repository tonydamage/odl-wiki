==Technical Architecture==

In Hydrogen Release,  the OpenDaylight controller consists of the following modules:

* [[OpenDaylight_Controller:Architectural_Framework#Service_Abstraction_Layer|AD-SAL]] - API-Driven Service Abstraction Layer
* AD-SAL Network Service Functions for OpenFlow-capable nodes:
** Switch Manager
** Statistics Manager
** Host Tracker
** ARP Handler
** Forwarding Rules Manager (FRM)
** Topology Manager
* [[OpenDaylight_Controller:Architectural_Framework#High_Availability|Clustering and High-Availability Services]] for AD-SAL 
* [[OpenDaylight_Controller:MD-SAL:Developer_Guide|MD-SAL]] - Model-Driven Service Adaptation Layer - a set of infrastructure common and generic services for applications and plugins (basically, a "plumbing" that connects applications and plugins to each other).
* MD-SAL Base Network Functions: 
** Topology Exporters
** Inventory Managers
* MD-SAL Network Service Functions for OpenFlow-capable nodes:
** Forwarding Rules Manager (FRM)
** Statistics Manager
* MD-SAL Netconf Connector (Southbound Netconf Plugin) 
* [[OpenDaylight_Controller:MD-SAL:Restconf#How_it_works|MD-SAL Restconf Connector]] (Northbound Restconf Plugin) - an infrastructure component that renders REST APIs for device/service models loaded into the controller
* [[OpenDaylight_Controller:Config:Main|Config Subsystem]] - Netconf/Yang based framework for configuration, performance and fault management of controller infrastructure and plugins deployed into the controller
* NSF Adapters - Network Service Function Adapter that allow the MD-SAL based OF1.0/1.3 Plugin to talk with AS-SAL based Network Service Functions


The controller architecture, as implemented for Hydrogen, is shown in the following figure. The figure shows the Service Provider edition example,, which in addition to  Base Edition controller components and plugins, contains the BGP-LS/PCEP and LISP plugins, the Affinity, LISP and PCEP Services, and the D4A Defense application.
