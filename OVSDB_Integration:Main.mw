==Introduction==

OVSDB Integration is a bundle for OpenDaylight that will implement the Open vSwitch Database management protocol, allowing southbound configuration of vSwitches.

==Technical Overview==

===JSON-RPC Overview===

JSON-RPC is a remote procedure protocol which allows our ovsdb client to call methods that exist on the ovsdb server, allowing us to provision bridges, ports, interfaces, tunnels, and more in the database. Any rpc request is formatted as follows:

<syntaxhighlight lang="java">
{
    "method":<string>,
    "params":[<object>],
    "id":<string> or <integer>
}
</syntaxhighlight>

This will invoke the value given in "method" on the server, passing in the parameters specified in order. Parameters can be simple strings, or complicated json objects. RPC response messages also have a standard formatting:

<syntaxhighlight lang="java">
{
    "result":[<object>],
    "error":<error>,
    "id":<string> or <integer>
}
</syntaxhighlight>

The library [https://code.google.com/p/jsonrpc4j/ jsonrpc4j] will take care of serializing and deserializing these standard messages for us, but for most situations we will need to deserialize the "result" value ourselves as it is most likely a complicated json object. Also, for many methods the "params" array will contain json objects, we define these as actual java objects which then get deserialized into json strings on the server side. Using the jackson streaming API it is possible to call methods and process responses using only string manipulation, but it is less convenient and as of now we are not using this method. The [http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pfaff-ovsdb-proto-02#section-4.1 ovsdb protocol draft] describes the methods and their responses in detail.

====Example: add bridge====
<syntaxhighlight lang="javascript">
{
    "method":"transact",
    "params":[
        "Open_vSwitch",
        {
            "row": {
                "bridges": [
                    "named-uuid",
                    "new_bridge"
                ]
            },
            "table": "Open_vSwitch",
            "uuid-name": "new_switch",
            "op": "insert"
        },
        {
            "row": {
                "name": "br1",
                "type": "internal"
            },
            "table": "Interface",
            "uuid-name": "new_interface",
            "op": "insert"

                    "new_port"
                ]
            },
