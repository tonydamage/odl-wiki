== Introduction ==

OpenContrail Plugin will provide the integration/interworking between the OpenDaylight controller and OpenContrail.  The plugin will enable OpenDaylight to utilize OpenContrail’s networking capabilities such as:

* Cloud Networking – Dynamic and reliable management of virtual overlay networks with scalability important for Private clouds for Enterprises or Service Providers, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) for Cloud Service Providers.
* Network Function Virtualization (NFV) in Service Provider Network and service chaining for enterprise deployments – Streamlined service chaining utilizing L3 overlay solution.

This project is dependent on the controller project hence it'll be in offset 1.
