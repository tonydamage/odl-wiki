== Introduction

THIS IS ONLY CANDIDATE RELEASE PLAN - NOT FINAL VERSION. PLEASE, FEEL
FREE TO CONTACT PROJECT LEAD FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.

The reservation project uses the Group-Based Policy project (GPP) to
create temporal reservations or policies. Initial scope will be with
bandwidth but could use all the policies contained in the GPP like
managing traffic or applying firewall policies between two sets of
endpoints on a temporal frame.

The project is defined in a Yang model, that uses terminology in the
GPP.
