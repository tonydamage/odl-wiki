== Code Language ==
The Code is designed to run as a single process on a DOVE Service Appliance or
any Linux-based OS system. It's comprised of code written in C and Python. The
C code is compiled into a dynamically load(able) library that can be invoked
by the Python scripts. Each component on the DCS is written in either C or
Python.

The C/Python interaction is implemented using simple Extension and Embedding
Techniques. The Python libraries and header files needed to compile the DCS
is described in the README_PYTHON file.

== Code Structure ==
Each folder in the code repository implements a specific functionality.

* init - Contains the initialization files and files for functionality that was too simple to have a folder of its own for e.g. logging.
* inc - Contains all the header files that are used by all components
* fd_process - File descriptor processing routine. Currently implemented using "poll" since the number descriptors are 2-3 but should be converted to "epoll" at some time.
* client_server_protocol - The (currently) UDP based communication channel between clients (DOVE Switches and Gateways) and the DCS.
* data_hander - Handles the run-time database of objects stored in the DCS.
