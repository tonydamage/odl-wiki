|Task |Source |Assignee |Outcome |Due Date |Status
|Upload the persistence release plan to Lithium release plan for review
|Persistence:Weekly Meeting#Lithium[01/21/2015] |Fabiel Zuniga | |
|*Completed*

|Investigate more on how system testing and CI is done for persistence.
Is it Robot? we create a test app using SQLite for CI?
|Persistence:Weekly Meeting#Lithium[01/21/2015] | | | |*New*

|Investigate what applications will use the database? Can they come with
their own database as part of their plugin and install the relevant
service without having to restart the controller?
|Persistence:Weekly Meeting#Lithium[01/21/2015] | | | |*New*

|Update the JPA support section saying we will ship with SQLite DB by
default |Persistence:Weekly Meeting#Lithium[01/21/2015] |Fabiel Zuniga |
| |*Completed*

|Investigate Nexus Repository Binary artifacts. What is it?
|Persistence:Weekly Meeting#Lithium[01/21/2015] |Fabiel Zuniga | |
|*Completed*

|Look at an approach to hook persistence into MD-SAL framework before
API freeze |Persistence:Weekly Meeting#Lithium[01/21/2015] |The Team | |
|*In Progress*

|Follow up with Uyen to see where the common API should be placed?
Possibilities: persistence, controller or yang-tools.
|Persistence:Weekly Meeting#Lithium[01/21/2015] |Fabiel Zuniga
|persistence-common module will be created for common classes. Later
they can be moved if appropriated. | |*Completed*

|Update the release plan to update Expected dependencies on Other
projects. Dependencies are ODL parent, controller and yang-tools as of
now |Persistence:Weekly Meeting#Lithium[01/21/2015] |Fabiel Zuniga | |
|*Completed*

|Work with serialization project team and get them on board
|Persistence:Weekly Meeting#Lithium[01/21/2015] |The Team | | |*In
Progress*

|Work with yang-tools project to get support on Identifiable interface
definition for Persisted objects.
|Persistence:Weekly Meeting#Lithium[01/21/2015] | | | |*New*

|update the wiki to accept questions before the meeting and also a notes
of the meeting |Persistence:Weekly Meeting#Lithium[01/21/2015] |Fabiel
Zuniga | | |*Completed*

|Define databases to support: SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Galera, HBase,
etc. Ideally only one relational database is needed if it works out of
the box. |01/30/2015 ODL Persistence Followup |The Team a|
MySQL will be the only supported database by the persistence project for
Lithium.

* It will run out of the box if MySQL service is installed as part of
the persistence module (No need for the user to do it manually)
* Galera Cluster consists of a database server — MySQL, MariaDB or
Percona XtraDB — that then uses the Galera Replicator to manage
replication. If the AAA project requires Galera, it should be possible
to enable clustering if MySQL is already used.
* The TSDR team will have an HBase implementation for a NonSQL database,
which can be moved to the persistence project in a future release.

 |02/04/2015 |*Completed*

|Investigate query requirements and whether XQUERY would work as the
standard query language for MD-SAL. |01/30/2015 ODL Persistence Followup
|Nachiket Abhyankar |XQuery is very close to SQL and there are readymade
tools available to convert XQuery into SQL statements. Parity with SQL
is thus easily achieved. However, this might be a challenge for NoSQL
databases and that is a different investigation. |02/04/2015
|*Completed*

|Confirm if objects will be modeled data in TSDR and AAA projects.
|01/30/2015 ODL Persistence Followup | | |02/04/2015 |*New*

|Investigate whether the AKKA persistence interface offers everything
the persistence project needs to persist data. |01/30/2015 ODL
Persistence Followup | | | |*New*

|Investigate whether it's possible to define a database per Shard.
|01/30/2015 ODL Persistence Followup | | | |*New*

|Investigate to see if mySQL can be wrapped as a karaf feature.
