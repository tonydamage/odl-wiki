== How to test

The persistence framework is meant to be an internal service and thus
primary consumers include applications and services. There are is no
RESTful Web Services nor User interface available for the end user.
Thus, in order to enable system testing a
https://github.com/opendaylight/persistence/tree/master/test-app[test
application] was created which consumes the persistence services and
exposes operations via RESTful web services. This allows system test
frameworks (like Robot) to exercise the persistence services and assert
the result.
