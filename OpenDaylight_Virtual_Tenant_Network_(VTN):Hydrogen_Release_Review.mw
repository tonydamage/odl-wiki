==Architectural Issues==
==Security Considerations==
==Quality Assurance (test coverage, etc)==
=== VTN Coordinator ===
Unit Tests have been developed for all the modules and are getting executed in every build.The unit tests for odcdriver module which caters for ODL has very high coverage. Functional testing scripts have been developed which covers all the features supported. This is manually executed before every patch is merged. Work is on to create the tests for VTN Coordinator in Continuous Integration Test Suite.
=== VTN Manager ===
Unit Tests and Integration tests are run during every build. They offer extensive coverage on all sections of VTN Manager code.
Tests for VTN Manager have been created in Continuous Integration test suite also.
