# Start mininet to use OF 1.3: [[OpenDaylight_OpenFlow_Plugin::Test_Environment|OpenFlow 1.3 Enabled Software Switches / Environment]]
# Use RESTCONF to see the topology information.

== Restconf for Topology ==

The REST url for listing all the nodes is:

<pre>http://localhost:8080/restconf/operational/network-topology:network-topology/</pre>

You will need to set the Accept header:
<pre>Accept: application/xml</pre>
You will also need to use HTTP Basic Auth with username: admin password: admin.

Alternately, if you have a node's id you can address it as
<pre>http://localhost:8080/restconf/operational/network-topology:network-topology/topology/<id></pre>
for example
<pre>http://localhost:8080/restconf/operational/network-topology:network-topology/topology/flow:1/</pre>
