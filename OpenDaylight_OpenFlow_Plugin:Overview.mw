= Conceptual Overview =

OpenFlow is a vendor-neutral standard communications interface defined to enable interaction between the control and forwarding layers of an SDN architecture. The OpenFlow plugin project intends to develop a plugin to support implementations of the OpenFlow specification as it develops and evolves. Specifically the project has developed a plugin aiming to support OpenFlow 1.0 and 1.3.x. It can be extended to add support for subsequent OpenFlow specifications. The plugin is based on the Model Driven Service Abstraction Layer (MD-SAL) architecture (https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Controller:MD-SAL). This new OpenFlow 1.0/1.3 MD-SAL based plugin is distinct from the old OpenFlow 1.0 plugin which was based on the API driven SAL (AD-SAL) architecture. 

= Scope =
* Southbound plugin and integration of OpenFlow 1.3.x library project
* Ongoing support and integration of the OpenFlow specification
* The plugin should be implemented in an easily extensibile manner
* Protocol verification activities will be performed on supported OpenFlow specifications
