= Conceptual Overview =

OpenFlow is a vendor-neutral standard communications interface defined to enable interaction between the control and forwarding layers of an SDN architecture. The OpenFlow plugin project intends to develop a plugin to support implementations of the OpenFlow specification as it develops and evolves. Specifically the project will continue to provide support for the existing OpenFlow 1.0 implementation, developing a plugin aiming to support OpenFlow 1.3.x, and further supporting subsequent OpenFlow specifications. The plugin shall be implemented in such a way that existing and future OpenFlow protocol specifications can be integrated and published for the OpenDaylight controller.

= Scope =
* Southbound plugin and integration of OpenFlow 1.3.x library project
* Ongoing support and integration of the OpenFlow specification
* The plugin should be implemented in an easily extensibile manner
* Protocol verification activities will be performed on supported OpenFlow specifications

= Openflow1.3 Support for Opendaylight =

= Software Architecture Strawman Proposal =

The following figure illustrates a strawman proposal for the OpenFlow Plugin architecture.
