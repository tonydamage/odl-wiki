Logging in ODL container is done via [http://logback.qos.ch/ Logback]. Comprehensive documentation is available at 
http://logback.qos.ch/documentation.html

By default logging messages are appended to stdout of the java process and to file logs/opendaylight.log .
When debugging a problem it might be useful to increase logging level:
<source>
<logger name="org.opendaylight.controller" level="DEBUG"/>
</source>
Logger tags can be appended under root node <configuration/>. Name of logger is used to select all loggers to which specified rules should apply. Loggers are usually named after class in which they reside. The example above matches all loggers in controller - they all are starting with org.opendaylight.controller . There are 5 logging levels: TRACE,DEBUG,INFO, WARN, ERROR.
Additionally one can specify which appenders should be used for given loggers. This might be helpful to redirect certain log messages to another file or send them to syslog or over SMTP. See logback documentation for details.
