== 2.3 (Posting Reviews) ==

CURRENT
4. Reviews may in some circumstances be combined (for example a creation and graduation review) for a project seeking to come into Daylight that is already mature in its previous venue). Note, if reviews are combined, the review document need only go through a single 2 week review period (ie, if project combines graduation and promotion review, it need not wait 4 weeks, just the 2).

PROPOSED
4. Reviews may in some circumstances be combined (for example a creation and graduation review) for a project seeking to come into Daylight that is already mature in its previous venue). Note, if reviews are combined, the review period is the aggregate of review periods for each of the combined stages. For example, if project combines graduation and promotion review, it needs to wait 2+2 = 4 weeks).

== 2.3.1.e  (Graduation review) ==

CURRENT
Committers identified

PROPOSED
The project committers admitting at least three additional committers not from the originating company

== (new) 2.3.1.h ==

PROPOSED
The project having accepted patches from non-originator company contributors.

== 2.3.2.1c  (Graduation review) ==

CURRENT
History of Releases  (using Mature Release Process)

PROPOSED
History of releases within an open source governance model, using a Mature Release process. The project must show that it can issue releases within an open governance model, with major contributions by a set of diverse committers.

== (new) 2.3.3.1a  (Graduation review) ==

PROPOSED
Real-world users.  This project must be demonstrated to be used by a commercial or research entity towards a useful implementation of SDN that solves real-world problems.


== Another attempt at Committer Diversity Requirements ==
* proposed by Chris Wright

=== 2.3 Reviews ===
==== 2.3.3 Promotion Review ====

Proposed addition:

1.b Diverse Community of Committers and Contributors

I believe this captures the spirit of the +3non-company-of-origin idea w/out specifying numbers, leaving the TSC to apply appropriate judgement as per "Vendor Neutrality" and "Active Community."

== Minor typo in Bootstrap Process ==
* proposed by Chris Wright

=== 6 Bootstrap Process ===

CURRENT
2. If a project enters is in 'bootstrap' state...

PROPOSED
2. If a project enters in 'bootstrap' state...

== Clarification of Bootstrap Process ==
* proposed by Paul McKenney and Chris Wright
(note: this renders above typo fix obsolete)
(note: this is largerly clarifying, a minor change in the need for project
to accept/deny TSC position w/in one 1wk)

=== 6 Bootstrap Process ===

CURRENT
At the time of the formation of the OpenDaylight Foundation, there
are expected to be several initial projects contributed. These initial
projects will come in at various levels of maturity. In order to sort
these projects into the most appropriate Project Lifecycle state in a
way that is clear, consistent, and fair:

1. Prior to a date to be decided by the TSC in its first meeting
not less than 1 month and not more than 6 months after
OpenDaylight launch a projects may decide to either
a. Seek entry in 'bootstrap' state (explained more below)
b. Seek entry via the steady state Project Lifecycle (ie,
propose for Incubation)

2. If a project enters is in 'bootstrap' state, at the first meeting
of the official (post-formation) TSC after it petitions to
exit bootstrap state, the TSC will decide the proper Project
Lifecycle state for the project based on criteria rooted in the
steady state Project Lifecycle.

3. Once in a non-bootstrap state a project follows the steady state
Project Lifecycle.

PROPOSED
At the time of the formation of the OpenDaylight Foundation, there
are expected to be several initial projects contributed. These initial
projects will come in at various levels of maturity. In order to sort
these projects into the most appropriate Project Lifecycle state in a
way that is clear, consistent, and fair:

1. The TSC will choose a bootstrap-request deadline.  This deadline
shall not be earlier than one month after OpenDaylight launch,
nor shall it be later than six months after launch.  Given that
OpenDaylight launch occurred on April 8, 2013, the range of
possible deadlines extends from May 8, 2013 to October 8, 2013.
(The TSC selected a 3-month deadline, which maps to July 8, 2013.)

2. At any time prior to the bootstrap-request deadline, a project
may request entry into bootstrap state.  Please note that projects
may alternatively elect to follow the steady-state Project
Lifecycle by creating a proposal for Incubation.  Bootstrap state
is not a requirement, but is instead an additional option that
is available prior to the bootstrap-request deadline.

3. At its first meeting after receiving a bootstrap request, the TSC
will decide whether or not the project should be permitted to enter
bootstrap state.

4. A project in bootstrap state may petition to exit bootstrap
state.  This petition will preferably request entry into a given
Project Lifecycle state, but it may also elect to leave choice
of the Project Lifecycle state to the TSC's discretion.

5. At the first meeting following a bootstrap-exit petition, the TSC
will make a decision on the petition:
a. Leave the project in bootstrap state, or
b. Select the proper Project Lifecycle state for the
project based on the steady-state Project Lifecycle
criteria.

This meeting will preferably include representatives of the
project.  However, these representatives do not have a vote
unless they are already TSC members.

6. The project has one week following the TSC's decision to
either accept that decision or to elect to remain in bootstrap
state.

7. After a given project enters a non-bootstrap state, that project
follows the steady state Project Lifecycle.

== Add declaration of repo name to Creation Review ==

* Proposed by Ed Warnicke

In section 2.3.1(1) between bullet 1 and 2 add:

2. Repository Name, should be: 
a. Lower case
b. Short
c. Suitable to use as a Java/C identifier like a package name)

Additionally correct the diagram in the beginning of section 2.
