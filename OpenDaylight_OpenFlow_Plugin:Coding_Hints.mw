If using eclipse, following compiler settings might be useful either during coding or while fixing errors.

Especially useful warnings are:
* name shadowing
* null checks
* missing case in switch block
* missing break in case
* unused variables/parameters
* annotations checks (@override)
* access to non accessible member of enclosing type

And of course warnings upon missing javadoc comments for public classes, members and methods.
