===Major Features===

Defense4All is an SDN application for detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks. It communicates with OpenDaylight Controller via the ODC north-bound REST API to:
# Monitor behavior of protected traffic - the application sets flow entries in selected network locations to read traffic statistics for each of the PNs (aggregating statistics collected for a given PN from multiple locations).
# Divert attacked traffic to selected AMSs – the application set flow entries in selected network locations to divert traffic to selected AMSs. When an attack is over the application removes these flow entries, thus returning to normal operation and traffic monitoring.
Defense4All can optionally dynamically configure defined AMSs, monitor them or collect and act upon attack statistics from them. It contains a reference implementation pluggable driver to communicate with Radware’s DefensePro AMS.
Defense4All  presents its north-bound REST and CLI APIs to:
# Control and configure the application (runtime parameters, ODC connectivity, AMSs in domain, PNs, etc.).
# Obtain reporting data – operational or security, current or historical, unified from Defense4All and other sources (like ODC, AMSs).

===Target Environment===

====For Execution====

*'''Operating Systems''':
** RHEL 6.1/CentOS 6.1 (64-Bit)
** RHEL 6.4/CentOS 6.4 (64-Bit)
** Debian 7.x (Stable version, 64-Bit)
** Ubuntu 12.04 or later (64-Bit)
*'''Java''': A Java 7-compliant runtime environment.
*'''Cassandra''': Cassandra 2.0

====For Development====

'''Linux OS''' - Any of the OSs for execution.
'''Java''' - A Java 7-compliant JDK.
'''Maven''' - Maven 2 or 3
'''Git''' - Connectivity to ODL Git
'''Editing/debugging/running''' - Any choice, for instance Eclipse for Linux.
'''Cassandra''' - Cassandra 2.0 in the same machine as Defense4All.
'''Minimal environment to run and test DDoS attacks''' - Normal traffic generator, attack traffic generator, server, OVS switch, ODC. AMS is not mandatory, but advisable. Currently Defense4All has plugin to Radware's DefensePro.
