This page contains ideas for work items that need to be done. It's just an unprioritized parking lot at this point.

* Add documentation generator from yang tools into the controller runtime. When the controller finds a new model, it can auto-generate documentation for it as well. Make the documentation available in the controller's web server.
* Fix configuration packaging; right now, config models for all projects need to be included in the config subsystem, which is in the controller
* Code generation from models: 
** Skeletons for service providers and service consumers
** More advanced checking (parameter ranges, for example)
* WADL generation from yang modules
* Python language binding for yang modules and remote Python library for controller clients
* JavaScript language binding: generate JavaScript from models in runtime, which could be downloaded by clients at runtime
