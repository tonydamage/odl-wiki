==Conversion Rules==


===Data Node Container===

Each [[OpenDaylight_Controller:MDA:YANG_Metamodel#Data_Node_Container |Data Node Container]] is represented by Java interface which describes it's structure.
The structure is inferred from mapping rules for concrete types of Data Schema Definitions.

===Leaf Node Definition===

Leaf Node Definition results in adding bean property (getter,setter) in the interface generated for the parent Data Node Container.




=== Augmentation Target===

Interface generated for YANG data node which is also Augmentation Target, extends '''Extensible''' interface from
[[OpenDaylight_Controller:SAL:Evolution:API_Design_Principles,_Patterns#Pattern:_Extension_Interface_Pattern| Extensible Interface]] contract
the Extensible interface is provided in yang-binding artefact.
