[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6020|RFC 6020 - YANG - A Data Modeling Language for NETCONF] defines syntax and semantics of YANG models in concrete
terms but does not describe common abstraction (or meta-model). In order to better understand the YANG and to use it for code generation and modeling
we defined an set of abstractions (traits) which describes various behavior of the YANG concepts and generated code.

==Augmentation Definition==

The extensibility of data models in the YANG is solved by introducing concept of augmentations:

   YANG allows a module to insert additional nodes into data models,
   including both the current module (and its submodules) or an external
   module.  This is useful for example for vendors to add vendor-
   specific parameters to standard data models in an interoperable way.

In YANG <c>augment</c> statement defines augmentation target, augmentation

===Augmentation Target===

Augmentation Target is node in model, which could be extended by augmentation which is defined
by Augmentation Definition.
