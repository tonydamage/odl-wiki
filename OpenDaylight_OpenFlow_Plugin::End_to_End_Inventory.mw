== Introduction ==

The purpose of this page is to walk you through how to see the Inventory Manager working end to end with the openflowplugin using OpenFlow 1.3.

Basically, you will learn how to:

# Run the Base Edition with the new openflowplugin
# Start mininet to use OF 1.3
# Use RESTCONF to see the nodes appear in inventory.

== Building a Base Edition that has the new openflowplugin ==

# Checkout the openflowplugin project (if you need help with this see [[GettingStarted:Pulling,_Hacking,_and_Pushing_All_the_Code_from_the_CLI|Pulling Hacking and Pushing All the Code from the CLI]] ).
# cd into the openflowplugin/distribution/base directory
#: <pre>cd openflowplugin/distribution/base</pre>
# Pull in the three missing Gerrits (if they have not yet been merged)
# https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/2608/
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/2614/
# https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/2662/
# Build the distribution
#: <pre>mvn clean install</pre>
# Run the controller
#: <pre>cd target/distributions-openflowplugin-base-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-osgipackage/opendaylight/</pre>
#: <pre>./run.sh -debug</pre>

== Getting Mininet with OF 1.3 ==

[https://www.dropbox.com/s/dbf9a372elqs1s1/mininet-of-1.3.zip Download Mininet VM Upgraded to OF 1.3]

(or you could build one yourself [[Openflow Protocol Library:OpenVirtualSwitch|Instructions for setting up Mininet with OF 1.3]] ).

== Running Mininet with OF 1.3 ==

From within the Mininet VM, run:

<pre> sudo mn --topo single,3  --controller 'remote,ip=<your controller ip>:6653' --switch ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow13</pre>

== Restconf for Inventory ==

The REST url for listing all the nodes is:

<pre>http://localhost:8080/restconf/datastore/opendaylight-inventory:nodes/</pre>

You will need to set the Accept header:
<pre>Accept: application/vnd.yang.api+xml</pre>
You will also need to use HTTP Basic Auth with username: admin password: admin.

Alternately, if you have a node's id you can address it as
<pre>http://localhost:8080/restconf/datastore/opendaylight-inventory:nodes/node/<id></pre>
for example
<pre>http://localhost:8080/restconf/datastore/opendaylight-inventory:nodes/node/openflow:1</pre>

=== How to hit Restonf with Postman ===

[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm?hl=en Install Postman for Chrome]

In the chrome browser bar enter 
<pre>chrome://apps/</pre>
And click on Postman.

Enter the URL.  Click on the Headers button on the far right.  Enter the Accept: header.  Click on the Basic Auth Tab at the top and setup the username and password.  Send.
