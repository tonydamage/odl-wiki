== Introduction ==
We provide a python based automatic test tool here to make the API response validation robust and efficient.

=== Prerequisites ===
* Linux based OS
* Java 1.7+
* Python 2.6/2.7 environment
* Python requests library, can be install through <pre> pip install requests </pre>
* [https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/GettingStarted:Developer_Main OpenDaylight Controller]
* [http://mininet.org/walkthrough/ Mininet] or other SDN simulator

=== Test Steps ===
The CSIT test will be simple and automatic with the tool.
* Download the test tool code
<pre> git clone git@github.com:yeasy/CSIT_Test.git </pre> or <pre>git clone https://github.com/yeasy/CSIT_Test.git</pre>
* Start the OpenDaylight controller at local host (If not on local host, should modify the controller ip accordingly in Mininet).
* Start Mininet to emulate a 2-layer tree topology network; make sure it is connected to the controller
<pre>sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=127.0.0.1 --mac --topo tree,2</pre>
* Login in to the controller's web UI (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8080) with admin:admin
* Configure to add a gateway, name = gateway, subnet = 10.0.0.254/24
* In Mininet, run h1 ping h2 to make sure the network is connected.
* Run the test tool by <pre>python run.py</pre> The test will output the processing on each module, and warnings if there's any failure.

=== Integration with Robot Framework ===
