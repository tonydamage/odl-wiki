== Meeting Agenda ==

* Tasks progress
* Q&A

== Minutes of Meeting 02/10/2013 ==

* Project news
** GIT repository: We have Integration repository together with all develop tools: Jenkins, Nexus, etc.. Thanks Andy
** Release vehicles integration: This is not trivial task as OSGi bundles may fail to start even if the build is succesful. Ed has already set up build artifacts, configure Verify and Merge jobs in Jenkins. The build artifacts need some polishing as well some test needs to be in place to check OSGi bindle. Moiz is helping here as well.

* Java test progress
** Moiz and Swaraj are checking the Java code, starting with the controller project. Once the code is reviewed, it would be good to start a discussion in the community on what will be the minimum quality standard.
** 
** Every project that has dependencies on other projects (all except Yangtools) needs to have at least one integration test job in Jenkins. Luis has contacted all projects asking for the Integration Job: some accepted, some refused because they build very often and this would introduce innecessary overhead, some are holding until they have their existing tests more refined

* Test tools progress
** Luis to work with Carol to specify HW and SW requirements for the VMs in ODL
** Ericsson Lab has already provisioned one physical box to host test VMs as well (more RAM has been ordered as well)

* Release Features
** Punal is checking controller code to understand features.
** Luis checked some code as well and published on Integration wiki.

* Q&A
** How to review and submit code: Ed ilustrated us on how to review and commit code. Thanks Ed.
** Jenkins jobs ?: everytime a project commits code and this gets merged and tested in Jenkins, 2 tests should be triggered: 1) Every other project that has dependency on the just changed project has to run its own build test to verify changes in the new artifact do not impact project build (this is what we need to check and push now); and 2) A release vehicle (i.e. basic, virtualization, service provider, full flavor) gets built and tested within an automated environment (this is what we are trying to setup now).

== Minutes of Meeting 9/25/2013 ==

* Project news
** Project contacts: we have contact names for all projects contributing in ODL. Check vHackfest wiki and project introduction mails from yesterday.
** ODL resources for test: Andrew (ODL sysadmin) has offered to help us with this. ODL test resources are also part of tomorrows TSC meeting agenda.  
** Integration project review: TSC will review our project during the call tomorrow. All Integration group members are welcome to join. Meeting details in TSC wiki.
** TWS calls: every Monday at 1PM (PST), they are very recommended for all Integration team members. Meeting details in TWS wiki.

* Java test progress
** Moiz and Swaraj are checking the Java code, starting with the controller project.
** JUnit tests are very minimum according to Moiz. We can check code coverage in Sonar and ask developers to write more tests.
** Every project that has dependencies on other projects (all except Yangtools) needs to have at least one integration test job in Jenkins. 

* Test tools progress
** Carol has already install some tools at home: Robot, Testopia, Jenkins.
** Carol wonders when they can be moved to ODL space. We need to get the project standard setup in place first (Repo, Jenkins, Nexus, etc..).
** Carol will work closely with Andrew to get the tools installed in ODL. Hopefully this activity can start next week.

* Q&A
** How to build and run a release vehicle: We do not really need to build the code again, we just need to create a delivery artifact that is made of other projects deliveries (same as VTN). This is also the reason we might need our own git repo. Thanks Ed.
** System Test flow: everytime a project commits code and this gets merged and tested in Jenkins, 2 tests should be triggered: 1) Every other project that has dependency on the just changed project has to run its own build test to verify changes in the new artifact do not impact project build (this is what we need to check and push now); and 2) A release vehicle (i.e. basic, virtualization, service provider, full flavor) gets built and tested within an automated environment (this is what we are trying to setup now).
