== Meeting Minutes of Group 1 ==

=== 12/11/2013 === 
  
* Project news 
** OpenDaylight release date has been postponed, Phil Rob is working with the projects on the new dates  
** We have 33 test cases running in system test (CSIT). We are currently working on adding some NSF improvements. 
** OF 1.3 plugin is coming progressively, we will get things to test every week and we will help with the verification with top priority 
** In parallel we are organizing the work around SP and Virt editions. Check Trello tool
** OVSDB and other plugin projects would benefit if there was a VM in OpenDaylight (mininet, OVS, etc...) they could use to test their code when it gets pushed in the system (verify job). We will abord this idea on the next TSC call.

* Progress 
** Progress has been tracked down using Trello tool. Still high priority on all that is in Base editon, medium priority for SP and Virt editions. 
  
* Q&A 
** Phil Rob asked what will be the impact of leaving OF 1.3 out of Hydrogen release. Although it is not a desirable scenario, since OF 1.0 is already covered in CSIT, leaving OF 1.3 out will translate in less test effort and shorter test time before the release.

=== 12/4/2013 ===

* Project news
** OpenDaylight release date will be postponed, the new proposal will be presented next TSC call
** We have 36 test cases running in system test (CSIT). Last additions on OVSDB and NSF improvements
** OF 1.3 plugin not ready yet. We are working on some CBench performance test for by the time it will be available.
** Contributors are more than welcome to start testing SP and Virtualization editions

* Progress
** Progress has been tracked down using Trello tool. High priority now on all tasks around Base edition: improve NSF, OF1.3 and Cbench

* Q&A

=== 11/27/2013 ===

* Project news
** We have 1 new contributor: Laksmi Kandadai from Ericsson, she will looking at NSF TCs improvement
** CSIT already in place with 17 TCs running automatic
** OF1.3 plugin will be ready next Monday. At least Punal, Guanpeng and Luis will work on getting it tested
** System Test environment available in instructions as well as in VM
** We need volunteers to prepare some material and speech for ODL Summit next year. Mail sent to the list

* Progress
** Progress has been tracked down using Trello tool. High priority now on all tasks around Base edition: NSF, OF1.3, OVSDB, etc...
** Arash, who has recently joined Integration group, volunteers to work on Clustering Manager

* Q&A

=== 11/20/2013 ===

* Project news
** We have 2 new contributors: Arash Eghtesadi from Inocybe and Anton Basil from Veryx Technologies. Welcome both!
** Jenkins jobs needed for system test already in place (thanks Andy). Luis made a quick tour on the new Jobs
** There is some discussion on whether VTN Mgr and Affinity can work together in Virtualization edition. Lets see what is the outcome of this.

* Progress
** Progress has been tracked down using Trello tool. Only hot items (i.e. blocking the CSIT relase) are: CSIT documentation in the wiki and the mininet VM handling. Luis is taking care of both and there will be an update very soon.

* Q&A
** What is the strategy for Sonar? Should the projects include Sonar support or not? We need to ask Giovanni. Luis will send a mail.

=== 11/13/2013 ===

* Project news
** Jenkins strategy already sort out. Luis made a quick demo on Jenkins at the Ericsson Lab.
** Lot of discussion around REST API convention, this will impact the testing in the sense that we will need to write new (or replace) some test cases for the NB APIs. For now we just need to keep an eye open on when these changes will happen.  
** OF1.3 is not ready yet but it is possible to run a simple case of inventory and check the new generated MD-SAL APIs.

* Progress
** Progress has been tracked down using Trello tool. Only hot item is the setup of the VMs in OpenDaylight. Andrew is working on providing the VM access.

* Q&A
** How are we going to support the Test VMs? some people in the Integration team will get an account to login into the VMs. This account will not have admin rights so for any task involving root access we will have to file a ticket to OpenDaylight support (Linux Foundation)
** Which projects in Opendaylight are aware the controller clustering services? Nobody knows... so Luis will ask the community.
 
=== 11/6/2013 ===

* Project news
** Lot of progress in the system test area in the last week, hopefully we keep this momentum as we would like to have some system test in place by end of next week.

* Java test progress
** Moiz was not in the call today. Luis will sync with him later this week.
** Nitin is already in contact with Moiz to help with Java works
** Still 2 pending tasks: 1) See what is needed to have projects reporting in Sonar (Andrew will help here) and 2) Setup OSGi bundle load sanity check for the release vehicles build.

* Test tools progress
** Baohua and Denghui have created Python libraries to make REST requests as well as implemented some test cases in Phython.
** Carol set up Robot framework in the Open Lab at Ericsson and wrote basic instruction.
** Andrew has almost finished preparing the VMs in OpenDaylight. He is working on the access and he will have probably something ready by next week. 
** We will meet ON Lab test people this Friday, we will send information after the meeting. Anyone interested in attending the meeting, let me know.
** IMPORTANT: We need to work on a good Jenkins plan like which triggers and jobs will be handled by Master Jenkins in ODL and Slave Jenkins in Test tools image.

* Continuous System Test progress
** Few changes in the test plan but basically frozen until we get more inputs on APIs and system test in place.
** We have a first test case running in Robot (thanks Baohua and Dengui) using CSIT test tools. 
** Question pop up on whether to use standard or custom libraries (like CSIT test tools) in Robot. We need to decide very soon on this!

* Release Features progress
** Everybody is invited to update Release Features wiki. 
** So far we miss NB APIs info from most of the projects. We will get this info through the system test conversation with the projects.

=== 10/30/2013 ===

* Project news
** New people joining the Integration team: Saritha, Phuc and Duy, welcome to OpenDaylight!

* Java test progress
** Moiz was not in the call today. Luis will sync with him later this week.
** Nitin is already in contact with Moiz to help with Java works
** Still 2 pending tasks: 1) Check in Sonar how code coverage is being tracked per module/bundle and 2) Setup OSGi bundle load sanity check for the release vehicles build.

* Test tools progress
** Carol is setting up Robot framework in the ODL Lab at Ericsson.
** Andrew is back, he is working on the VMs in OpenDaylight space. VM content is not 100% defined yet.
** Swaraj has met ON Lab test people, he will send some info and also setup a meeting with Luis, Carol and anyone interested.
** IMPORTANT we need to make a decision on the test framework for OpenDaylight very soon as the system test implementation depends on this!

* Continuous System Test progress
** Luis and Baohua started new task to write test plan for release vehicles. First draft for Base edition is already available.
** Swaraj met Prasanth to talk about Java system test. This will be introduced later after we have the Robot/Python in place.
** Baohua and Denghui already made some python scripts to be used in system test.
** Is it possible to program test cases while waiting for test framework tool (Robot, ON-Test, etc...) ? if so lets do it.

* Release Features progress
** Everybody is invited to update Release Features wiki. 
** So far we miss NB APIs info from most of the projects. We will get this info through the system test conversation with the projects.

=== 10/23/2013 ===

* Project news
** ODL Lab at Ericsson San Jose is now available to evaluate/debug test tools. There is idea to setup similar thing in China. Luis will follow up with China team.

* Java test progress
** Moiz will take a look on Sonar to check how code coverage is being tracked per module/bundle, after that we can see which bundles have poor or none coverage and do something about. Luis will follow up this.
** Moiz will try to import the existing controller sanity check for OSGi bundle load into the release vehicles build. These ones may fail even more often than controller project.
** Nitin and Moiz will meet this week to sync up on Java works.

* Test tools progress
** Carol and Denghui (or any other contributor) can now test Jenkins/Robot framework in the ODL Lab.
** Andrew is busy this week, we will sync on the VMs requirements once he is back.
** Swaraj will meet ON Lab test people to see whether we can leverage anything for our Lab. 
** Luis started to ask device information to plugin projects (OF, SNMP, LISP, BGP/PCEP, OpenDOVE)

* Continuous System Test progress
** Luis will open a new task including mentors for our CSIT deliverable.
** So far we have discussion around 2 frameworks for CSIT: Robot for python and existing Maven for java, both have their pros and cons. We will most likely setup both so that testers can choose whichever they like.
** Swaraj will meet Prasanth to understand more about Java system test

* Release Features progress
** Everybody is invited to update Release Features wiki. 
** So far we miss NB APIs info from most of the projects. Luis will ask this info as part of the system test requirements (already started).  

=== 10/16/2013 ===

* Project news
** We have a new collaborator, his name is Prasanth, works in Cisco, and he will be collaborating with Test tools for now as he he has past experience on these. Welcome Prasanth!

* Java test progress
** Moiz and Swaraj did not call today. Luis will sync with them later this week.
** New collaborator Nitin have Java knowledge so it would be good if he could support Moiz. Luis will connect them together.

* Test tools progress
** Carol sent HW and SW requirements for the VMs to Andrew. Only concern here is Mininet as not sure if it can run on RedHat.
** Andrew is going to be busy the next week so not clear when we are going to get the ODL VMs.
** Test VMs are ready in Ericsson. Luis will send details to carol and other test tools people.

* Release Features
** Lot of discussion ongoing on MD-SAL transition plan, hopefully we get a picture of the final state for Hydrogen release very soon.
** API freeze is this week but apparently is not what we thought, it is more like APIs can be generated as long as backwards compatibility is maintained. This means we will not know final APIs (including NB REST APIs) till code freezing at M5. Anyway we will start doing System Test on already known NB REST APIs.

=== 10/09/2013 ===

* Project news
** OpenStack-OpenDaylight Integration: Part of our E2E test is to integrate OpenStack-OpenDaylight in Ericsson Lab. This work can also be leveraged to present a Lab workshop during ODL Summit next year. Luis has initiated conversations with Chris Wright (RedHat) as we need OpenStack guidance and support for the integration.
** We have a new collaborator calling in the meeting today, his name is Nitin, works in Brocade (Colorado), and he is eager to help with Integration and Test tasks. Welcome Nitin!

* Java test progress
** Moiz and Swaraj are checking the Java code, starting with the controller project. Once the code is reviewed, it would be good to start a discussion in the community on what will be the minimum quality standard.
** Moiz is writing JUnit tests as well as helping other project people to do so. In addition he is setting up release vehicule building test. Thanks Moiz.
** Swaraj is checking ON.Lab Test infrastruture (TestON) to see whether we can leverage something for our tests.

* Test tools progress
** Carol sent HW and SW requirements for the VMs to Andrew. Only concern here is Mininet as not sure if it can run on RedHat.
** Andrew is going to be busy the next week so not clear when we are going to get the ODL VMs. Backup plan is to use Ericsson Lab while these get ready.

* Release Features
** Punal is checking controller code to understand features.
** Luis checked some code as well and published findings on Integration wiki.

* Q&A
** What is the status of OF13 plugin: AFAIK it is not part of the release vehicles yet as there is a lot of development going on in the OF plugin project.
** Are we going to test redundant controllers: Yes but same as for other projects that need extra HW or infrastructure (VTN, Dove, Defense4All,..), we might need to setup E2E System Test in the Lab for proper testing.

=== 10/02/2013 ===

* Project news
** GIT repository: We have Integration repository together with all develop tools: Jenkins, Nexus, etc.. Thanks Andy
** Release vehicles integration: This is not trivial task as OSGi bundles may fail to start even if the build is succesful. Ed has already set up build artifacts, configure Verify and Merge jobs in Jenkins. The build artifacts have still some issues, Moiz is helping here as well.

* Java test progress
** Moiz and Swaraj are checking the Java code, starting with the controller project. Once the code is reviewed, it would be good to start a discussion in the community on what will be the minimum quality standard.
** Moiz is writing JUnit tests as well as helping other project people to do so. Thanks Moiz.
** Moiz will also setup a WebEx session for other Integration members with Java knowledge to catch up and help him with Java tests.
** Every project that has dependencies on other projects (all except Yangtools) needs to have at least one integration test job in Jenkins. Luis has contacted all projects asking for the Integration Job: some accepted, some refused because they build very often and this would introduce unnecessary overhead, some are holding until they finalize their existing Java tests.

* Test tools progress
** Luis to work with Carol to specify HW and SW requirements for the VMs in ODL
** Ericsson Lab has already provisioned one physical box to host test VMs as well (more RAM has been ordered as well)

* Release Features
** Punal is checking controller code to understand features.
** Luis checked some code as well and published findings on Integration wiki.

* Q&A
** How to build release vehicles: Ed showed us how to build release vehicles explaning all involved files. Thanks Ed.
** How to review and submit code: Ed illustrated us on how to review and commit code. Thanks Ed.
** How to setup Jenkins so that if we have several merge jobs in the queue, release integration job only runs at the end: Not so easy, according to Eddy we will need another tool on top of Jenkins to notice this situation and eventually delete release integration jobs.

=== 09/25/2013 ===

* Project news
** Project contacts: we have contact names for all projects contributing in ODL. Check vHackfest wiki and project introduction mails from yesterday.
** ODL resources for test: Andrew (ODL sysadmin) has offered to help us with this. ODL test resources are also part of tomorrows TSC meeting agenda.  
** Integration project review: TSC will review our project during the call tomorrow. All Integration group members are welcome to join. Meeting details in TSC wiki.
** TWS calls: every Monday at 1PM (PST), they are very recommended for all Integration team members. Meeting details in TWS wiki.

* Java test progress
** Moiz and Swaraj are checking the Java code, starting with the controller project.
** JUnit tests are very minimum according to Moiz. We can check code coverage in Sonar and ask developers to write more tests.
** Every project that has dependencies on other projects (all except Yangtools) needs to have at least one integration test job in Jenkins. 

* Test tools progress
** Carol has already install some tools at home: Robot, Testopia, Jenkins.
** Carol wonders when they can be moved to ODL space. We need to get the project standard setup in place first (Repo, Jenkins, Nexus, etc..).
** Carol will work closely with Andrew to get the tools installed in ODL. Hopefully this activity can start next week.

* Q&A
** How to build and run a release vehicle: We do not really need to build the code again, we just need to create a delivery artifact that is made of other projects deliveries (same as VTN). This is also the reason we might need our own git repo. Thanks Ed.
** System Test flow: everytime a project commits code and this gets merged and tested in Jenkins, 2 tests should be triggered: 1) Every other project that has dependency on the just changed project has to run its own build test to verify changes in the new artifact do not impact project build (this is what we need to check and push now); and 2) A release vehicle (i.e. basic, virtualization, service provider, full flavor) gets built and tested within an automated environment (this is what we are trying to setup now).
