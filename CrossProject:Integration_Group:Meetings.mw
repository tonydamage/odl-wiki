== Minutes of Group 1 Meeting ==
=== 10/09/2013 ===

* Project news
** OpenStack-OpenDaylight Integration: Part of our E2E test is to integrate OpenStack-OpenDaylight in Ericsson Lab. This work can also be leveraged to present a Lab workshop during ODL Summit next year. Luis has initiated conversations with Chris Wright (RedHat) as we need OpenStack guidance and support for the integration.
** We have a new collaborator calling in the meeting today, his name is Nitin, works in Brocade (Colorado), and he is eager to help with Integration and Test tasks. Welcome Nitin!

* Java test progress
** Moiz and Swaraj are checking the Java code, starting with the controller project. Once the code is reviewed, it would be good to start a discussion in the community on what will be the minimum quality standard.
** Moiz is writing JUnit tests as well as helping other project people to do so. In addition he is setting up release vehicule building test. Thanks Moiz.
** Swaraj is checking ON.Lab Test infrastruture (TestON) to see whether we can leverage something for our tests.

* Test tools progress
** Carol sent HW and SW requirements for the VMs to Andrew. Only concern here is Mininet as not sure if it can run on RedHat.
** Andrew is going to be busy the next week so not clear when we are going to get the ODL VMs. Backup plan is to use Ericsson Lab while these get ready.

* Release Features
** Punal is checking controller code to understand features.
** Luis checked some code as well and published findings on Integration wiki.

* Q&A
** What is the status of OF13 plugin: AFAIK it is not part of the release vehicles yet as there is a lot of development going on in the OF plugin project.
** Are we going to test redundant controllers: Yes but same as for other projects that need extra HW or infrastructure (VTN, Dove, Defense4All,..), we might need to setup E2E System Test in the Lab for proper testing. 

=== 10/02/2013 ===

* Project news
** GIT repository: We have Integration repository together with all develop tools: Jenkins, Nexus, etc.. Thanks Andy
** Release vehicles integration: This is not trivial task as OSGi bundles may fail to start even if the build is succesful. Ed has already set up build artifacts, configure Verify and Merge jobs in Jenkins. The build artifacts have still some issues, Moiz is helping here as well.

* Java test progress
** Moiz and Swaraj are checking the Java code, starting with the controller project. Once the code is reviewed, it would be good to start a discussion in the community on what will be the minimum quality standard.
** Moiz is writing JUnit tests as well as helping other project people to do so. Thanks Moiz.
** Moiz will also setup a WebEx session for other Integration members with Java knowledge to catch up and help him with Java tests.
** Every project that has dependencies on other projects (all except Yangtools) needs to have at least one integration test job in Jenkins. Luis has contacted all projects asking for the Integration Job: some accepted, some refused because they build very often and this would introduce unnecessary overhead, some are holding until they finalize their existing Java tests.

* Test tools progress
** Luis to work with Carol to specify HW and SW requirements for the VMs in ODL
** Ericsson Lab has already provisioned one physical box to host test VMs as well (more RAM has been ordered as well)

* Release Features
** Punal is checking controller code to understand features.
** Luis checked some code as well and published findings on Integration wiki.

* Q&A
** How to build release vehicles: Ed showed us how to build release vehicles explaning all involved files. Thanks Ed.
** How to review and submit code: Ed illustrated us on how to review and commit code. Thanks Ed.
** How to setup Jenkins so that if we have several merge jobs in the queue, release integration job only runs at the end: Not so easy, according to Eddy we will need another tool on top of Jenkins to notice this situation and eventually delete release integration jobs.

* Project news
** Project contacts: we have contact names for all projects contributing in ODL. Check vHackfest wiki and project introduction mails from yesterday.
** ODL resources for test: Andrew (ODL sysadmin) has offered to help us with this. ODL test resources are also part of tomorrows TSC meeting agenda.  
** Integration project review: TSC will review our project during the call tomorrow. All Integration group members are welcome to join. Meeting details in TSC wiki.
** TWS calls: every Monday at 1PM (PST), they are very recommended for all Integration team members. Meeting details in TWS wiki.

* Java test progress
** Moiz and Swaraj are checking the Java code, starting with the controller project.
** JUnit tests are very minimum according to Moiz. We can check code coverage in Sonar and ask developers to write more tests.
** Every project that has dependencies on other projects (all except Yangtools) needs to have at least one integration test job in Jenkins. 

* Test tools progress
** Carol has already install some tools at home: Robot, Testopia, Jenkins.
** Carol wonders when they can be moved to ODL space. We need to get the project standard setup in place first (Repo, Jenkins, Nexus, etc..).
** Carol will work closely with Andrew to get the tools installed in ODL. Hopefully this activity can start next week.

* Q&A
** How to build and run a release vehicle: We do not really need to build the code again, we just need to create a delivery artifact that is made of other projects deliveries (same as VTN). This is also the reason we might need our own git repo. Thanks Ed.
** System Test flow: everytime a project commits code and this gets merged and tested in Jenkins, 2 tests should be triggered: 1) Every other project that has dependency on the just changed project has to run its own build test to verify changes in the new artifact do not impact project build (this is what we need to check and push now); and 2) A release vehicle (i.e. basic, virtualization, service provider, full flavor) gets built and tested within an automated environment (this is what we are trying to setup now).

* Project news
** Read the US meeting minutes.
** [http://juniper.mwnewsroom.com/press-releases/JUNIPER-NETWORKS-INTRODUCES-OPENCONTRAIL-AN-OPEN-S-nyse-jnpr-1050858 OPENCONTRAIL] news.

* Tasks progress
** Baohua ([https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/CrossProject:Integration_Group:Release_Features Release Features]) is reading the code of the controller project to collect necessary feature information. And has created and updated the release feature wiki page.
** Guangpeng ([https://wiki.opendaylight.org/index.php?title=CrossProject:Integration_Group:CIT_Java CIT Java]) has pulled the controller code last days and is examining the building process. In addition, he is learning the usage of some test tools.
** Denghui ([https://wiki.opendaylight.org/index.php?title=CrossProject:Integration_Group:Test_Tools Test Tools]) is learn the test tool usage from  the wiki page.

* Q&A
** Do we need to deploy the test tools locally, or how to access the test server later?
*** From Luis: We plan 2 build 2 test setups and both will provide access to our team members to program test cases. The first one will be in OpenDaylight cloud and will be made of a few VMs: controller, mininet, REST client, test tools, etcâ€¦ The second one will be built in Ericsson Lab in San Jose to do more E2E testing. 
** How should we start to review and write the test code?
*** Need more discussion here, not started yet.

* Other Issues
** Find more convenient way to hold the meeting.
