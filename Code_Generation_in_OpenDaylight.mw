==MD-SAL==

There are two types of code generation going on in MD-SAL. 
# Java Interfaces and DTO generation from the YANG Models. These go under target->generated-sources.  This is well supported under IntelliJ Idea. Not sure if there are issues in Eclipse.
# Xtend is used for  template based code generation  and also simply as an alternative to java in some places. Xtend compiles into Java Source Code. Xtend is well supported in Eclipse including direct debugging of Xtend Code. IntelliJ does not have any support for Xtend. There are plans limit the use of Xtend to code generation and eliminate all other usage. There are Bugs in Bugzilla to track those.
#* There is some evidence that while Eclipse ''supports'' Xtend, it does not actively find directories with generated sources after importing.
