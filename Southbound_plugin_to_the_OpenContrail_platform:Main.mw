Welcome to the Southbound plugin to the OpenContrail platform project page!

== Introduction ==

This project will provide the integration/interworking between the OpenDaylight controller and the OpenContrail platform. This combined open-source solution will seamlessly enable OpenContrail platform capabilities within the OpenDaylight project. The southbound plugin to the OpenContrail platform will enable OpenDaylight to utilize the OpenContrail platform's networking capabilities.

Please see Project Proposal page as below:

* [[Project_Proposals:Southbound plugin to the OpenContrail platform|Project Proposal]]

== Technical Overview ==

The southbound plugin to the OpenContrail platform will enable OpenDaylight to utilize the OpenContrail platform's networking capabilities such as:

* Cloud Networking – Dynamic and reliable management of virtual overlay networks with scalability important for Private clouds for Enterprises or Service Providers, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) for Cloud Service Providers.

* Network Function Virtualization (NFV) in Service Provider Network and service chaining for enterprise deployments – Streamlined service chaining utilizing L3 overlay solution.

== High Level Design ==

The neutron calls to NeutronAPIService within OpenDaylight will be intercepted by southbound plugin, which will be developed as one of the standard OpenDaylight southbound plugins. The plugin in turn will use Contrail API-lib methods to make REST calls to OpenContrail for networking capabilities.
