Welcome to the Southbound plugin to the OpenContrail platform project
page!

[[introduction]]
== Introduction

This project will provide the integration/interworking between the
OpenDaylight controller and the OpenContrail platform. This combined
open-source solution will seamlessly enable OpenContrail platform
capabilities within the OpenDaylight project. The southbound plugin to
the OpenContrail platform will enable OpenDaylight to utilize the
OpenContrail platform's networking capabilities.

Please see Project Proposal page as below:

[[getting-started]]
== Getting Started

The southbound plugin to the OpenContrail platform will enable
OpenDaylight to utilize the OpenContrail platform's networking
capabilities such as:

* Cloud Networking – Dynamic and reliable management of virtual overlay
networks with scalability important for Private clouds for Enterprises
or Service Providers, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Virtual
Private Clouds (VPCs) for Cloud Service Providers.

* Network Function Virtualization (NFV) in Service Provider Network and
service chaining for enterprise deployments – Streamlined service
chaining utilizing L3 overlay solution.

[[high-level-design]]
== High Level Design

The neutron calls to NeutronAPIService within OpenDaylight will be
intercepted by southbound plugin, which will be developed as one of the
standard OpenDaylight southbound plugins. The plugin in turn will use
Contrail API-lib methods to make REST calls to OpenContrail for
networking capabilities.
