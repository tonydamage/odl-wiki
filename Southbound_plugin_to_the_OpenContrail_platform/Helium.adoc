[[introduction]]
== Introduction

OpenContrail Plugin will provide the integration/interworking between
the OpenDaylight controller and OpenContrail. The plugin will enable
OpenDaylight to utilize OpenContrail’s networking capabilities such as:

* Cloud Networking – Dynamic and reliable management of virtual overlay
networks with scalability important for Private clouds for Enterprises
or Service Providers, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Virtual
Private Clouds (VPCs) for Cloud Service Providers.
* Network Function Virtualization (NFV) in Service Provider Network and
service chaining for enterprise deployments – Streamlined service
chaining utilizing L3 overlay solution.

This project is dependent on the controller project hence it'll be in
offset 1.
