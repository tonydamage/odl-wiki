Welcome to the "Secure Network Bootstrapping Infrastructure" project page!

= Introduction =

The Secure Network Bootstrapping Infrastructure (SNBI) project securely and automatically brings up an integrated set of network devices and controllers. Typically, operators must perform some manual key distribution process before secure communication is possible between a set of network devices. Instead, SNBI uses a zero-touch approach to bootstrapping that leverages manufacturer-installed IEEE 802.1AR certificates to secure even the initial communications. SNBI devices and controllers automatically discover each other, get an IP-address assigned, and establish secure IP connectivity. In addition, this discovery process reveals the physical topology of the network, exposes each type of a device (i.e. whether it is a regular network device or a controller), and assigns the domain for each device. This device type and domain information can also be used for initiating controller federation processes. As part of the SNBI project a basic infrastructure to host, run, and lifecycle-manage multiple network components/functions within a network device is created. These components/functions can include individual network element services, such as performance measurement, traffic-sniffing functionality, or traffic transformation functionality.
