== Transaction Coordinator ==
The TC module provides the two phase commit coordination functionality for [[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):VTN_Coordinator|VTN coordinator]] components.
It consists of two subcomponents
:*[[#Transaction_Coordinator_(TC)|Transaction Coordinator (TC)]]
:*[[#Transaction_Coordinator_Library_(TCLIB)|Transaction Coordinator Library (TCLIB)]]

== Transaction Coordinator (TC) ==
The Transcation Coordiantor module implements the two phase commit operation.

The main functions of this module are
:*TC is started from uncd daemon during startup of [[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):VTN_Coordinator|VTN coordinator]].
:*Responsible for two phase commit operation in VTN
:*Receives requests from [[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):VTN_API#VTN_Service_Java_API_library|VTN service]] during Commit and Audit operations.
:*Invokes lower layer [[#Transaction_Coordinator_Library_(TCLIB)|TCLIB]] API (i.e. [[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Unified Provider Logical Layer (UPLL)|UPLL]] API, [[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Unified Provider Physical Layer (UPPL)|UPPL]] API or [[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):OpenDaylight Controller Driver (ODC Driver)|ODC Driver]] API) via IPC framework.

== Transaction Coordinator Library (TCLIB)==
The main functions of this module are
:*TCLIB will be loaded as a module in [[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Unified Provider Logical Layer (UPLL)|UPLL]], [[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Unified Provider Physical Layer (UPPL)|UPPL]] and [[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):OpenDaylight Controller Driver (ODC Driver)|ODC Driver]] daemon.
:*Responsible for handling messages to the daemons from [[#Transaction_Coordinator_(TC)|TC]].
:*The daemons will install their handler with TCLIB, the handlers will be invoked on receiving messages from [[#Transaction_Coordinator_(TC)|TC]].
