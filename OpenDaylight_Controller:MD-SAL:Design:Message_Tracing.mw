=== Correlation ID ===

==== Intra-JVM Correlation ====



==== Correlation with external protocols ====

One of use-cases for Correlation ID and message correlation is correlation of
actions spanning multiple systems. Not all  protocols provides
correlation capabilities or similar concept, but Correlation ID could be retrofitted to some of them.

===== Netconf =====

Netconf allows client-submitted message-id
for each rpc invocation. Correlation ID
could be propagated to remote system as part
of message-id.

=== Correlation in context of MD-SAL  ===

==== RPCs ====

==== Notifications ====
==== Data Transaction ====

==== Data Change Events ====


== Best Practices for Correlation ==

* Any component which starts processing incoming message / request from
  external component (e.g. Openflow plugin packet-in, Restconf request)
  SHOULD:
:* Reuse existing remote Correlation ID if possible
:* Allocate new Correlation ID with proper tag, which uniquely identify entry-point.
* Any component which does processing based on incoming request:
:* Triggers requests to other in-process components MUST also propagate Correlation ID, to these requests.
:* SHOULD log that it started executing in context of request.  should be logged.
* Any component which uses executor, shared executor MUST make sure, execution is processed with correct correlation ID.
