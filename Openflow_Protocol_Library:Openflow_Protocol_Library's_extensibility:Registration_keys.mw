=== Possible openflow extensions and their keys ===
There are three vendor specific extensions in Openflow v1.0 and eight in Openflow v1.3.
These extensions are registered under registration keys, that are shown in table below:

<div  align="center">
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|-
! Extension type !! OpenFlow !! Registration key
|-
| Vendor message || 1.0 ||
|-
| Action || 1.0 || ExperimenterActionDeserializerKey(1, experimenter ID)
|-
| Stats message || 1.0 ||
|-
| Experimenter message || 1.3 ||
|-
| Match entry || 1.3 || MatchEntryDeserializerKey(4, ${oxmClass}, ${oxmField});<br /> key.setExperimenterId(experimenter ID);
|-
| Action || 1.3 || ExperimenterActionDeserializerKey(4, experimenter ID)
|-
| Instruction || 1.3 || ExperimenterInstructionDeserializerKey(4, experimenter ID)
|-
| Multipart || 1.3 || 
|-
| Multipart - Table features || 1.3 || 
|-
| Error || 1.3 ||
|-
| Queue property || 1.3 ||
