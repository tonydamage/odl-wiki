= Proposed OpenFlow Plugin Release Plan =
== Introduction ==
The OpenFlow plugin project will develop a plugin to support implementations of the OpenFlow specification as it develops and evolves. Specifically the project will continue to provide support for the existing OpenFlow 1.0 implementation, developing a plugin aiming to support OpenFlow 1.3.x, and further supporting subsequent OpenFlow specifications. The plugin shall be implemented in such a way that existing and future OpenFlow protocol specifications can be integrated and published for the OpenDaylight controller.

== Release Deliverables ==

Task	Resources	Dates	Dependencies	Current Status
OpenFlow Plugin Development for OpenDaylight		"M4 (Oct 16)
M4.5 Intermediate Milestone (Oct 31)
M5 Code Freeze for everything except REST API (Nov 13)
M5.5 Code Freeze for REST API (Nov 20)"	MD-SAL, OpenFlow Library, RESTCONF	
"Connection Handler + Session Manager + State Manager:

"	IBM + Cisco		OpenFlow Library	
a.      Server Startup / shutdown.		M4		Done
b.      Protocol Negotiation		M4	Handshake Design	Handshake Design Done
c.      Capability negotiation.          		M4	Handshake Design	Handshake Design Done
d.      Main and Auxiliary connection.		M4.5		Muthu has presented the first cut mind map design to the OF Plugin team on Oct 7. Some open questions still being discussed
e.      Call Flow freeze for MD-SAL and Plugin		M5		Muthu has presented the first cut mind map design to the OF Plugin team on Oct 7. Some open questions still being discussed
f.       Call flow freeze between Plugin and Library ( For non-connection related function).		M5		Muthu has presented the first cut mind map design to the OF Plugin team on Oct 7. Some open questions still being discussed
"Mapping Functions (between MD-SAL & the OF library):
"	Ericsson + Cisco	M5	MD-SAL & OpenFlow Library	Waiting on Consumer Code check-in by Tony Tkacik (Pantheon) - Prasanna will provide detailed estimate after that check-in (target Oct 10). For now we will assume this entire task will be ready by M5 - without the granular breakdown of the sub-tasks.
Switch Handler : 				
New Switch Notifications handler				
Topology Manager:				
Link discovery using LLDP request and response.				
Flow Programmer Service:				
Add/Delete/get/update flow.				
Add/Delete/get/update group.				
Add/Delete/get/update meter.				
Update/get Port/queue.				
Events like flow deleted/port down events.				
Stats:				
Flow / Group / Meter Statistics				
Port / Queue Statistics.				
Table Statistics.				
Feature Statistics.				
Packet Handler:				
Models (Flow/Group/Meter/Statistics - Ericsson)	Ericsson	M4	None	Done - except queues. Flow model has been retained from Pantheon OpenFlow 1.3 Flow Model - may need minor changes.
REST API (Flow/Group/Meter/Statistics - Ericsson) using RESTCONF & models		M5.5	Models & RESTCONF	Since a lot of interaction with the models (RESTCONF) - may be better to be done mostly by Ericsson - with help by others as needed. This task may be a test effort only since RESTCONF generates REST API from the models.
"Changes in Network Service Functions for OpenFlow 1.3 support
1) Forwarding Rules Manager
2) Switch Manager (hold table capabilities and allow queries for these - stretch goal as this is likely better done via TTPs/NDMs currently being standardized in the ONF Forwarding Abstractions Work Group)
3) Topology Manager (Minimal changes to support new OpenFlow 1.3 structures)
4) PCE (possible changes to support new logical ports supported in 1.3)"	"Controller main team??
OpenFlow Plugin Team??"	M5??	??	Ericsson investigating if these are needed & what changes needed
