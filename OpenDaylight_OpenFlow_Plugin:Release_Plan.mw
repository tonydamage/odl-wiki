= Proposed OpenFlow Plugin Release Plan =
== Introduction ==
The OpenFlow plugin project will develop a plugin to support implementations of the OpenFlow specification as it develops and evolves. Specifically the project will continue to provide support for the existing OpenFlow 1.0 implementation, developing a plugin aiming to support OpenFlow 1.3.x, and further supporting subsequent OpenFlow specifications. The plugin shall be implemented in such a way that existing and future OpenFlow protocol specifications can be integrated and published for the OpenDaylight controller.
