== Name  ==

SDNSim(SDN Simulation platform)

== Description  ==

SDN simulation platform provides users with a software development and testing environment, and users develop applications that can be tested at any time in the SDN simulation platform, simulation platform will provide virtual resources development needs, such as computing, storage and networks. Therefore, there will be three phases in this project, as follows. (1) core simulation engine: to provide basic resources. (2) core emulation layer: to provide network service functions. (3) sim code layer: to provide users to write code.

The following figure depicts the described components.
