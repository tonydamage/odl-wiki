[[overview]]
== Overview

In enterprise networks, more and more controller and network management
systems are being deployed remotely, such as in the cloud. Additionally,
enterprise networks are becoming more heterogeneous - branch, IoT,
wireless (including cloud access control). Enterprise customers want a
converged network controller and management system solution.

[[use-cases]]
== Use Cases

[[use-case-1-call-home]]
=== Use case 1: Call Home

*Network edge initiates the communication to the controller (NMS)*

*Scenario:*

The network edge may be deployed behind a NAT or a firewall, thus the
initiation of the session between the controller and network edge has to
be from the network edge side; otherwise NAT/FW may drop the session
setup request from controller side due to lack of proper states.

*Challenges:*

* Not all existing protocols provide call home mechanism, such as
telnet, vnc, snmp etc.;
* Future network service protocols are mandatorily required to provide
call home mechanism if it’s server side is on devices.

[[use-case-2-two-way-authentication]]
=== Use case 2: Two-way authentication

*Scenario:*

Rogue controller may behave as normal controller and respond to devices’
connection request;

*Challenges:*

* Some existing protocols don’t provide solid two-way authentication,
such as CAPWAP, SNMP etc.;
* The network edge should also authenticate the controller for its
following management and service provisioning.

Authentication,title="Two Way Authentication"]

[[use-case-3-unified-channel-and-single-point-authentication]]
=== Use case 3: Unified channel and single-point authentication

*Scenario:*

Multi-protocol connections between network edge and controller:

* ** Set up and maintain connections for each protocol;
** Provide different authentication and security mechanism;

*Challenges:*

* Various connections to handle, secure channel cannot be reused.
* No consistent and trusted security guarantee;
* Repetitious authentication between a single device and controller
