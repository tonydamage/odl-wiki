4.  Install ALTO feature: _feature:install odl-alto-all_
5.  Install Restconf feature: _feature:install odl-restconf-noauth_
6.  Shutdown karaf container: _logout_
7.  Update configuration according to ALTO:Lithium User Guide[User

8.  Run karaf container again, check if the features are installed:
_feature:list_ and you're good to go
9.  ODL log file is visible here: _./data/log/karaf.log_

Note: if you see a HTTP prompt to enter credentials, that is AAA project
