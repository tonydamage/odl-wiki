== Access ALTO Northbound using an ALTO Client

Accessing ALTO services using a standard ALTO client is easy: follow RFC
7285.

Assume that your OpenDayLight server is the locahost. You can use the
following curl command to get ALTO info:

curl -u karaf:karaf -X GET -D -
http://localhost:8181/controller/nb/v2/alto/

[[admin-alto-server]]
== Admin ALTO Server

infrastructure to manage the maps store at the ALTO server.
