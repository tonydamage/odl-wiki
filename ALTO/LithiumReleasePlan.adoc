[[expected-dependencies-on-other-projects]]
== Expected Dependencies on Other Projects

ALTO can benefit from data made available from BPG/LS PCEP. But the Data
Store provides a level of indirection to reduce coupling. Hence, we do
not list BPG/LS PCEP as dependency.

In the current release, ALTO has a feature called auto-network-map that
can compute a default network map from host tracker provided by
l2switch.

[[compatibility-with-previous-releases]]
== Compatibility with Previous Releases

N/A.

Lithium will be ALTO's first release.

[[themes-and-priorities]]
== Themes and Priorities

This release will focus on infrastructure and base framework build.
