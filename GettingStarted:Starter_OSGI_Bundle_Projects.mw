== Description ==

Anyone wanting to write an OSGI bundle to plug into the controller needs a starting place, a template if you will for the maven project for their bundle.


== Deliverables ==

# A 'starter' 'osgibundle/' and directory suitable for ODL projects to copy into the top level of their git repo containing stubs for the things you need to get an OSGI bundle going
# A wiki page explaining how to do so and modify them for their bundle

== Pointers ==

We have some examples to start from in:

The simplest example is probably [https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/gitweb?p=controller.git;a=tree;f=opendaylight/arphandler;h=4469e90464d55e9f1a9b7e176899a3f81190b18c;hb=HEAD Arphandler]
You will need: 
# A pom.xml that does not have the commons.opendaylight as a parent pom.
## With blanks to fill in, and comments on how to fill them in inline
# An Activator class, similarly with commented out sections to be worked with and comments inline explaining how to work with them.
== Notes: ==

# Please feel free to push these directories into a directory 'starters/' in the controller project

== Mentor ==

This task is mentored by Ed Warnicke, you can reach him most easily on IRC on Freenode with handle edwarnicke, but email to eaw@cisco.com also works :)
