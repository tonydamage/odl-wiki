== Description

VXLAN solves the scalability issue of VLAN and offers cross-datacenter
support. However, VXLAN relies on multicast between VTEPs for address
learning and broadcast. Multicast has scalability issue of its own,
especially in virtualized environment where each of the 10s if not 100s
of thousand hypervisors is a VTEP. Also, most data centers do not want
to support broadcast and multicast due to issues they impose to the
network infrastructure.

This project proposes and implements a scalable inter/intra-cluster&
inter/intra-datacenter VXLAN peer addressing solution without using
multicast. This same architecture applies to other virtualized L2 over
L3 overlay as well, e.g. NVGRE, which can be supported with minor code
change in later phases.

[[scope]]
== Scope

Scope of L2-over-L3 Peer Addressing includes:

* Providing openvswitch flow and configuration to support scalable peer
addressing in network virtualization/segmentation via L2-over-L3
overlay.
* Providing PeerAddressing OGSI module handling incoming VXLAN ARP
requests and replies with the corresponding encapsulated ARP replies.
* Providing PeerAddressingNorthbound REST service to for update/query of
peer addresses (GW & IP/MAC mapping) per virtualized L2 network
* Providing intra-cluster, inter-cluster support of scalable peer
addressing within or across data centers.

== Meets Board Policy (including IPR)

Yes. Most/all of the code is written from scratch & it meets Board
Policy.
