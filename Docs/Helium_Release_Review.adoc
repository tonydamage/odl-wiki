== Non-Code Aspects (user docs, examples, tutorials, articles)

We will provide the following core documentation deliverables (authored
in Asciidoc) for OpenDaylight's Helium release:

* Developer Guide
* Installation Guide
* Release Notes
* User Guide

== Schedule (initial schedule and changes over the release cycle)

The writing team joined the project halfway into the Helium release. By
necessity, we had to pare back the scope of the core documentation.
Barring any major issues, we will complete the deliverables listed above
and have them checked into the docs repository by the end of day Friday,
9/26/14. It looks like we will have some time after the release to
update the documentation, so we will work with the team to identify any
additional items that require coverage.
