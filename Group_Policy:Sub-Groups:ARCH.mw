'''Friday April 25'''

Agenda

Primary Goals
* Provide a clear picture of the Group-Based Policy Components where MD-SAL plays a significant role, from the point of view of messaging/routing. The conversation will probably touch on the data store aspects to some extent since this is related to messaging/routing, but we should attempt to focus primarily on messaging/routing.
* Describe the high-level flow between these Group-Based Policy Components.

There is likely to be a fair amount of whiteboarding going on, so for those in the South Bay area, you might prefer to attend the meeting in person at the Noiro Networks Sunnyvale office.

'''Current Architecture (Pre-MD-SAL) Configuration Flow'''
* OpenStack Group-Based Policy Plugin
* RESTCONF NB API
* Contract Composer/Policy Repository Endpoint Registry
* Subscription Interface
* Renderer (one of Native/OpFlex, ACI, OpenDOVE, OVSDB Network Virtualization, OpenFlow, etc)

'''Current Architecture (Pre-MD-SAL) Operational Flow'''

Events and status flow back up from the Renderer to the Enforcement Exception Database and Operational State components, which will then have northbound interactions with users

'''High-Level Flow Steps'''
# NB API to Policy Repository and Endpoint Registry
# Subscription Interface between Renderers and Policy Repository
# Events and status from Renderers back up to Enforcement Exception Database and Operational State
# Enforcement Exception Database and Operational State up to users

For each of these steps, we need to begin to gather requirements on MD-SAL messaging/routing.

For example, for step 2, in case of a native renderer, there are likely to be devices below that need everything related to a particular endpoint group.
How does subscription grab all the contracts provided by that endpoint group, all the contracts consumed by that endpoint group, and everything underneath?
If some contract is added and that endpoint group provides that contract, anything that subscribed to that endpoint group needs to get that contract in an event-driven manner.
Whether that happens directly, or something notifies it that a contract came into scope and then it subscribes to that contract, we need to figure that out.

* From Dave Lenrow:
* Service chaining for NFV and similar using policy (previously presented proposals to ODL TWS for doing this with Affinity) and wanted to discuss how we plan to support this in GBP
