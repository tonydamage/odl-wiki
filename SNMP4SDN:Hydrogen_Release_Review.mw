==Project Name==
SNMP4SDN

==Features==
* OpenDayLight SAL plugin
* Support SNMP & CLI as the south bound protocol to enable Ethernet switch on the SDN paradigm
* New mechanisms for topology discovery and switch discovery for Ethernet switch in SDN

==Non-Code Aspects (user docs, examples, tutorials, articles)==
* [[SNMP4SDN:Installation_Guide|Installation Guide]]
* [[SNMP4SDN:User_Guide|User Guide]]
* [[SNMP4SDN:Developer_Guide|Developer Guide]]

==Architectural Issues==
* The new switch detection is designed to be that the SNMP4SDN plugin would be informed if receiving the coldstart/warmstart SNMP trap sent from the switch, but it is possible that the trap gets lost

==Security Considerations==
* Authentication information is stored in a file (SNMP community, CLI username, CLI password), the data in the file could be encrypted for security

==Quality Assurance (test coverage, etc)==
* 16 APIs, 20 unit tests in total:
** FlowProgrammer: 3 APIs, 5 unit tests (all passed)
** ConfigService (extended APIs): 13 APIs, 13 unit tests (all passed)
** Switch discovery: 1 unit test (passed)
** Topology discovery: 1 unit test (passed)

==End-of-life (API/Features EOLed in Release)==
* EOLed extended APIs (deprecated APIs):
** addFdbEntry(), modifyFdbEntry(), deleteFdbEntry(), setSnmpHost(), setSnmpComm()
* DataPacketService is deprecated
** DataPacketService was designed to pass the received data packets to controller, or transmit data packets as the controller requires, but we found Ethernet switch cannot make this function because the switch is unable to modify mac address in packets)

==Bugzilla (summary of bug situation)==
None

==Standards (summary of standard compliance)==
* SNMP v2c

==Schedule (initial schedule and changes over the release cycle)==
* Flow configuration on ACL is not included in this release
