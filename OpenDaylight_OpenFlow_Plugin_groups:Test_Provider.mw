= Group : Test Provider =

Currently, the openflowplugin has a test-provider that allows you to push various flows through the system from the OSGI command line.  Once those flows have been pushed through, you can see them as examples
and then use them to see in the config what a particular flow example looks like.

== AddGroup : addGroup ==

Run the controller by executing:
<pre>
cd openflowplugin/distribution/base/target/distributions-openflowplugin-base-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-osgipackage/opendaylight
./run.sh
</pre>

Point your mininet to the controller by giving the parameters --controller=remote,ip=<IP address>.

Once you see your node (probably openflow:1 if you've been following along) in the inventory, at the OSGI command line try running:
<pre>
addGroup openflow:1 a# g#
</pre>
Where # is a number between 1 and 4 for grouptype(g#) and 1 and 28 for actiontype(a#). You can confirm that they were created on the switch.

== RemoveGroup : removeGroup ==

Run the controller by executing:
<pre>
cd openflowplugin/distribution/base/target/distributions-openflowplugin-base-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-osgipackage/opendaylight
./run.sh
</pre>

Point your mininet at the controller as described above.

Once you see your node (probably openflow:1 if you've been following along) in the inventory, at the OSGI command line try running:
<pre>
removeGroup openflow:1 a# g#
</pre>
Where # is a number between 1 and 4 for grouptype(g#) and 1 and 28 for actiontype(a#). GroupId should be same as that used for adding the flow. You can confirm that it was removed from the switch.

== ModifyGroup : modifyGroup ==

Run the controller by executing:
<pre>
cd openflowplugin/distribution/base/target/distributions-openflowplugin-base-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-osgipackage/opendaylight
./run.sh
</pre>

Point your mininet at the controller as described above.

Once you see your node (probably openflow:1 if you've been following along) in the inventory, at the OSGI command line try running:
<pre>
modifyGroup openflow:1 a# g#
</pre>
Where # is a number between 1 and 4 for grouptype(g#) and 1 and 28 for actiontype(a#). GroupId should be same as that used for adding the flow. You can confirm that they were created on the switch.
