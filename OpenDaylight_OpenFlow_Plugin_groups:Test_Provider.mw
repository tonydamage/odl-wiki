= Group : Test Provider =

Currently, the openflowplugin has a test-provider that allows you to push various flows through the system from the OSGI command line.  Once those flows have been pushed through, you can see them as examples
and then use them to see in the config what a particular flow example looks like.

== AddGroup : addGroup ==

From the
<pre>
cd openflowplugin/distribution/base/target/distributions-openflowplugin-base-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-osgipackage/opendaylight
./run.sh
</pre>

Point your mininet at the controller as described above.

once you can see your node (probably openflow:1 if you've been following along) in the inventory, at the OSGI command line try running:
<pre>
addGroup openflow:1 a# g#
</pre>
Where # is a number between 1 and 4 for grouptype(g#) and 1 and 28 for actiontype(a#). You can go confirm they were created on the switch.

== RemoveGroup : removeGroup ==

From the
<pre>
cd openflowplugin/distribution/base/target/distributions-openflowplugin-base-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-osgipackage/opendaylight
./run.sh
</pre>

Point your mininet at the controller as described above.

once you can see your node (probably openflow:1 if you've been following along) in the inventory, at the OSGI command line try running:
<pre>
removeGroup openflow:1 a# g#
</pre>
Where # is a number between 1 and 4 for grouptype(g#) and 1 and 28 for actiontype(a#). GroupId should be same as for the added flow. You can go confirm they were created on the switch.

== ModifyGroup : modifyGroup ==

From the
<pre>
cd openflowplugin/distribution/base/target/distributions-openflowplugin-base-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-osgipackage/opendaylight
./run.sh
</pre>

Point your mininet at the controller as described above.

<pre>
modifyGroup openflow:1 a# g#
</pre>
Where # is a number between 1 and 4 for grouptype(g#) and 1 and 28 for actiontype(a#). GroupId should be as that of addedFlow. You can go confirm they were created on the switch.
