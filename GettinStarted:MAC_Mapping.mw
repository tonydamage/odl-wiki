== Description ==

[[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Main| VTN Project]] needs developers
to implement MAC mapping function to make virtual network configuration more powerful.

VTN Project develops VTN Manager which is a set of OSGi bundles running in OpenDaylight Controller.
VTN Manager provides REST API and JAVA API for creating virtual networks in VTN model.

The current VTN Manager provides users with the following two ways to define
mappings between physical resources and virtual network.
* Port mapping
** Map a port of physical switch to a virtual interface of a vBridge (virtual bridge).
* VLAN mapping
** Map a VLAN network to a vBridge.


In addition to the above two ways, we think that VTN manager should provide
a way to describe relationships between physical resources and virtual network
based on MAC addresses.
We call this function MAC mapping.
