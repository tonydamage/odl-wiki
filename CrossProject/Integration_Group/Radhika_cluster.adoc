==OpenDaylight Controller Clus

Node - is a logical member of a cluster. Cluster - is a set of member
nodes joined together through a service Leader - is a single node in the
cluster that acts as a Master. When the node is a leader, it has full
access to the switch where it manages cluster convergence, partitions,
fail-over, load balancing etc.

Seed Nodes The seed nodes act as connection points for the new nodes
joining the cluster. Defining the seed nodes configuration value does
not have any influence on the running cluster itself. It is only
relevant for new nodes joining the cluster as it helps them to find
connection points. A new member can send this command to any current
member of the cluster, not only to the seed nodes.

Host Names

`netty.tcp {` +
`  hostname = "10.125.136.51"`

Define Seed Nodes Here, the seed nodes are defined in
https://github.com/opendaylight/controller/blob/master/opendaylight/md-sal/sal-clustering-config/src/main/resources/initial/akka.conf[akka.conf]
file found in /odl/configuration/initial/akka.conf. The changes must be
modified at two places in the file, under odl-cluster-data part and
under odl-cluster-rpc.

` cluster {` +
`   seed-nodes = ["akka.tcp://opendaylight-cluster-data@127.0.0.1:2550"]`

If there are 3 nodes running, the seed nodes must be defined as below-
Under odl-cluster-data

` cluster {` +
`    seed-nodes = ["akka.tcp://opendaylight-cluster-data@10.125.136.51:2550","akka.tcp://opendaylight-cluster-data@10.125.136.52:2550","akka.tcp://opendaylight-cluster-data@10.125.136.53:2550"]`

Under odl-cluster-rpc

` cluster {` +
`    seed-nodes = ["akka.tcp://odl-cluster-rpc@10.125.136.51:2551","akka.tcp://odl-cluster-rpc@10.125.136.52:2551","akka.tcp://odl-cluster-rpc@10.125.136.53:2551"]`
