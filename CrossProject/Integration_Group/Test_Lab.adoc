[[open-test-lab]]
== Open Test Lab

The framework for Continuous System Integration Test will be hosted in
existing OpenDaylight servers, in addition Ericsson offers a test
environment that can be used for:

* Get familiar with controller (DUT)
* Evaluate test tools
* Debug system test code

This is current Lab topology:

[[lab-access]]
=== Lab Access

Lab access is provided through SSH server with public key
authentication. Please follow the steps bellow:

* Generate a public key in the SSH client and mail it to
christopher.o.shea@ericsson.com along with your username.
* Once the key gets provisioned in the SSH server, do: *ssh
username@server2.verkstad.net (129.192.170.80)*. In case of
authentication problems please contact christopher.o.shea@ericsson.com
* The SSH server allows SSH forwarding (SSH tunnels) so you can
configure a many as you need (example to forward VNC: ssh -L
15900:10.125.136.37:5900 alias@server2.verkstad.net)
* Before start using the Lab, please BOOK the time
CrossProject:Integration_Group:Lab_Schedule[*here*].
* The VM images have 2 intefaces: one for operation (external access)
and one for traffic. Please use the second for doing test.
