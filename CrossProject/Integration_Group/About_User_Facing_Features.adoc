[[creating-user-facing-features]]
== Creating user-facing features

This wiki is just a summary of some of the conversations we have had in
the past regarding user facing feature so this is more a recommendation
than a mandate (at least in this release).

[[user-facing-features]]
=== User-facing Features

We understand user-facing features those exposed through Karaf console
(if it is a karaf feature) and we expect users to turn on/off regularly.

[[essential-functionality]]
=== Essential Functionality

Projects having user-facing features could define at least 1 base or
essential-functionality made of other small features that most users
(90/10) will consume via java, REST or GUI so it seems logical to define
something like:

* odl-- <- Java interfaces only
* odl---rest <- Java + REST
* odl---ui <- Java + REST +UI

for example:

* odl-openflowplugin-flow-services <- base openflow service
* odl-openflowplugin-flow-services-rest <- base openflow service + REST
* odl-openflowplugin-flow-services-ui <- base openflow service + REST +
UI

Other examples in case you do not find a good name for your essential
functionality :

* odl--plugin (if your project implements a plugin)
* odl--service (if your project looks more like a service)
* odl--core (if you plan to build other features on top)

[[additional-essential-functionalities]]
=== Additional Essential Functionalities

A project can provide additional essential-functionalities that are
logically separated and users can enable independently, we can treat
them the same way:

* odl-- <- Java interfaces only
* odl---rest <- for developers/users
* odl---ui <- for users

As guideline asking "would a non-developer network operator want to turn
this functionality on and off independently of other functionality?"
will result in projects making the right choice.

[[functionality-on-top]]
=== Functionality on Top

A project can also have functionality on top of the essential that users
would really like to turn on and off regularly (otherwise we can use
more hidden features for that):

* odl---
* odl---

Note that in this case we do not recommend to have -rest -ui in addition
but more if a user wants to have both REST and extra functionalities
enable:

* odl---rest
* odl---
* odl---

for example:

* odl-openflowplugin-flow-services-rest <- base openflow service + REST
* odl-openflowplugin-flow-services-tme <- base openflow service + table
miss enforcer app
* odl-openflowplugin-flow-services-nx <- base openflow service + nx
extensions

If you have defined your main functionality as odl--core, perhaps it
makes sense to define your extra features as:

* odl--
* odl--

[[things-to-avoid]]
== Things to avoid

And these are the things we do not recommend.

[[odl--all-feature]]
=== odl--all feature

During helium release we asked projects to define odl--all karaf feature
containing all available features for test purposes, in particular to
facilitate the â€œall-features"on kind of test we do in the integration
group to identify bundle conflicts. The problem with this is: 1) nobody
really understands what all means and 2) end-users normally prefer to
enable something that is called -all even when this involves a lot of
overhead and undesired SW. So for feature clarity and user experience we
recommend to avoid defining odl--all feature.
