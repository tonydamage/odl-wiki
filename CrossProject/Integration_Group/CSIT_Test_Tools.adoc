We are working on two CSIT test tools currently, the python based one
and the robotframework based one.

The python based tool provides automatic test tool to finish the CSIT
test robustly and efficiently, and can be found at

The robotframework based one is designed using the robotframework and
will be integrated with Jenkins in future. It can be found at
