[[introduction]]
== Introduction

The framework for Continuous System Integration Test will be hosted in
existing OpenDaylight servers at
CrossProject:Integration_Group:ODL_Test_Lab[ODL Test Lab]. In addition
Ericsson offers a test
environment(CrossProject:Integration_Group:Test_Lab[Open Test Lab at
Ericsson]) in America. In order to help more people (especially in the
East) to get familiar with ODP controller, Huawei established a new test
lab in China. Both labs can be used for:

* Get familiar with controller (DUT)
* Evaluate test tools
* Debug system test code

This page will introduce how to use Huawei’s lab. The following is
current Lab topology:

[[book-the-lab]]
== Book The Lab

To use the lab, you just need send request to administrator
(odp-lab@huawei.com). Before you send the email, please see a free time
slot at http://demo-odplab.huawei.com/[here].

[[lab-access]]
== Lab Access

Lab access is provided through SSH server with username/password. Every
time you book the lab, you will receive an email from odp-lab@huawei.com
which writes username/password pairs. In case of authentication
problems, just feel free to contact odp-lab@huawei.com. Please follow
the steps bellow to access the lab. There are 2 approaches to access the
SSH server. Please use the traffic subnet for test traffic and O&M
subnet for operation traffic.

[[access-lab-through-ssh-client-recommended]]
=== Access lab through SSH Client (recommended)

Execute command in prompt:

-----------------------------------
ssh username@demo-odplab.huawei.com
-----------------------------------

Then, use following commands to access VMs (172.16.54.11-14) and use
‘odluser1’ as password:

--------------------------
~$ssh odlsuer@172.16.54.11
~$ssh odluser@172.16.54.12
~$ssh odluser@172.16.54.13
~$ssh odluser@172.16.54.14
--------------------------

For SSH forwarding (SSH tunnels), execute (e.g. forwarding VNC traffic):

--------------------------------------------------------------
ssh –L 15900:172.16.54.11:5900 username@demo-odplab.huawei.com
--------------------------------------------------------------

Then just VNC to localhost:15900 to access 172.16.54.11’s desktop.

[[access-lab-through-web-gate]]
=== Access lab through web gate

For users who cannot work with port 22 (maybe behind a proxy or
firewall), SSH web gate is provided through http protocol. To access SSH
server through https, please visit URL at
https://demo-odplab.huawei.com/gateone[https://demo-odplab.huawei.com/gateone].
After start controller at , visit http://demo-odplab.huawei.com:8080 for
OpenDaylight web GUI.
