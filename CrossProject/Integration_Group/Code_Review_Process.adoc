[[review-groups]]
== Review Groups

And these are the areas we have in integration today:

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Review Group |Folder |Reviewers |Interested people
|Distribution code |/distributions |Ed Warnicke, Luis Gomez, Vratko

Integration committers and contributors please add your information
above.

How to fill above table:

* Reviewers: Integration committers or contributors that have expertise
and are available to review code
* Interested people: Anyone that wants to be in copy for either learning
or information reasons

[[review-process-guideline]]
= Review Process Guideline

This is a guideline for Integration code review. Exceptions are always
allowed with a good explanation.

[[general-rules]]
== General Rules

* A patch in integration can be reviewed and approved by just 1
committer
* The submitter will normally add the reviewers + Interested people from
the Review Groups table above to the patch Reviewers list
* A reviewer can give the following code:
** -2: I disagree with this patch
** -1: I agree with this patch but I would prefer you change this...
** +1: I agree with this patch and I would like someone else to
review/merge
** +2: I agree with this patch and I merge it
* If a committer does -1 or -2, this has to be followed by a good
explanation
* Committers merging a patch, DO NOT FORGET to cherry-pick to stable
branches if the patch applies

[[review-process]]
== Review Process

* The submitter will normally add the Review Group to the patch
Reviewers list
** Otherwise the first person opening the patch can do it
* If the patch is urgent the submitter will try to reach a reviewer from
the list
* If there is no reviewer available the submitter can ask any committer
that is available to review and approve the code

In case the patch was submitted by an Integration committer:

* If there is no committer available the submitter can go ahead and
approve its own patch but consider the following:
** Before merging ask yourself: Is this patch so important that I cannot
wait a committer to become available?
** If yes please explain the reasons why this patch cannot wait in the
merge message

[[ptl-responsibilities]]
= PTL Responsibilities

* Make sure there are enough active committers to review and approve
integration code
* Seek for Review Groups diversity (geographic, company, profession,
etc...)
* Watch the Open patch queue, make sure new patches get reviewers
assigned in a timely manner
* Watch the Open patch queue, make sure at least one person from the
review list gives patch feedback in a timely manner
* Revert someone else patch. This has to be very well explained
* Insure above rules and process are observed by committers
