[[continuous-integration]]
== Continuous Integration

OpenDaylight CI process is described on this
OpenDaylight_Controller:Development_Infrastructure_Overview[ link].
Tests are also part of the CI as shown in the picture below:

image:ci_infra_test.png[ci_infra_test.png,title="ci_infra_test.png"]

[[karaf-distribution]]
== Karaf Distribution

* Karaf distribution is a release vehicle for Lithium
* Projects need to define features in order to integrate in karaf
* Integration project will hold a Karaf distribution containing all the
features and bundles intended for release
** These are features defined in projects and included in the
integration Karaf distribution
* Optionally projects can build their own Karaf (or other) distribution
in their repositories
* In any case projects will recommended which
CrossProject:Integration_Group:About_User_Facing_Features[ user-facing
karaf features] need to be enabled for test

[[kinds-of-tests]]
== Kinds of Tests

These are "the classics" in OpenDaylight:

* *Unit Test (UT)*
** This is the test developers write in the code to verify bundle
functionality (e.g. JUnit)
** Runs automatically on project build
** Test results and code coverage reported to Sonar

* *Integration Test (IT)*
** This is the test developers write in the code to verify some
inter-bundle (feature) functionality (e.g. PAX-EXAM)
** Runs automatically on project build
** Test results and code coverage reported to Sonar (some limitations
exist with PAX-EXAM)

* *System Test (ST)*
** This is the test to verify multiple features at system level (e.g.
Robot FW)
** Runs on a test bed made of robot, controller and device instances
** Requires a karaf distribution as System Under Test (SUT)
** Test results reported in Jenkins at a minimum
** NOTE: We strongly recommend the use of Robot Framework for system
test (ST), because:
*** it is already running in OpenDaylight cloud and we have extensive
examples and tutorials
*** this will allow integration group to re-use the test code for the
multi-project karaf editions test

[[jenkins-job-builder]]
== Jenkins Job Builder

This release it is possible to have Jenkins jobs in Job Builder which
means:

* Jenkins jobs code will be stored in a central repository managed by LF
* Jenkins jobs will be execute in a central instance (e.g. no project
silos)

Among other things, this will allow a project:

* To trigger other project jobs
* To add an extra step in other project jobs (e.g. merge job) to trigger
own job (e.g. integration job)

* NOTE: We strongly recommend projects to adopt Jenkins Job Builder
infrastructure

[[test-strategy]]
== Test Strategy

The CI process includes 2 key events:

* *Code Submit ->*
** Upon code submit project verify job will build the project using the
submitted patch and so it will automatically run Unit Test (UT) and
Integration Test (IT)
** New in this release: We can optionally trigger System Test (ST) upon
code commit. This would be useful on sensitive projects that can break
others
*** NOTE: We are currently working on the options for doing this

* *Code Merge ->*
** Upon code merge, project merge job will build the project and so it
will automatically run Unit Test (UT), Integration Test (IT) and upload
artifacts to Nexus
** New in this release: Project will run System Test (ST) on project
recommended user-facing features using just uploaded artifacts
** New in this release: Downstream projects will trigger their own build
and System Test (ST)
*** NOTE: We have never tested before the chain of tests in dynamic VM
cloud, there is risk we cannot fulfill 100% the above

Autorelease project will produce different releases (weekly Release,
Release Candidate, Formal Release, etc...), for all of them:

* *Release Creation ->*
** New in this release: Upon release creation, project release test job
will run System Test (ST) on project recommended user-facing features
** Upon release creation, integration project release test jobs will run
System Test (ST) on multi-project Karaf editions
** New in this release: Integration project will provide "extra" longer
tests, scalability/performance, platform test, etcâ€¦

[[requirements]]
== Requirements

In this release projects are expected to:

* Setup the Continous Integration process according to
GettingStarted:Project Main#New_Project_Checklist[Project Checklist]
* New in this release: Report Unit Test (UT) and Integration Test (IT)
results to Sonar
* Define release karaf features and include them in the integration
Karaf distribution
* New in this release: Provide Integration and System Test (ST)
information for "user-facing" features (description, dependencies,
incompatibilities, project recommended karaf features, few test cases)
* New in this release: Write System Test (ST) for "user-facing" project
features
* New in this release: Run System Test (ST) on project recommended
user-facing features after Code Merge (new artifacts available in
Nexus), any upstream project Code Merge (new artifacts in Nexus) and any
Release Creation events [1]

[1] For projects running System Test outside OpenDaylight (external
Lab), they should provide at a minimum:

* New in this release: System Test (ST) report upon any Release Creation

[[timeline-for-deliverables]]
== Timeline for Deliverables

* *M1:* Projects join SR
** Projects must have elected their Project Leads
** New in this release: Projects specify a Test contact

* *M2:* Projects join CI
** Project GettingStarted:Project Main#New_Project_Checklist[ CI
Checklist] (including Sonar reporting) completed
** Participating Projects must have declared their final
Simultaneous_Release:DRAFT_Release_Plan_2014_Template[ Release Plan]
with all sections fully completed
** New in this release: Projects must specify whether they are going to
use OpenDaylight CI infrastructure for system test. It is recommended to
use the OpenDaylight CI infrastructure unless there is some resource
that is not available there, e.g., particular hardware or software.
** Start Test tools installation in rackspace. Projects that need any
extra configuration or resources for test in the OpenDaylight CI
infrastructure must have opened helpdesk tickets to add the
configuration or resources.

* *M3:* Functionality Freeze
** Projects must have release features defined and included in the
integration Karaf distribution. Instructions can be found in the
Karaf:Step by Step Guide[Karaf:Step by Step Guide]
** Integration project must set triggers to build integration project
and run integration System Test (ST) after any project Code Merge (new
artifacts in Nexus)
** New in this release: Projects must have filled out the
CrossProject:Integration_Group:Feature_Integration_System_Test_Template[
Integration and System Test template] for each user-facing features
(karaf and not karaf)
** New in this release: Integration project must provide Integration &
System test plan based on above feature templates (+2 wk offset)
** Start System Test (ST) integration: Automate controller deployment,
devices provisioning and system test run. Integration will provide
step-by-step guide for basic automation and robot

* *M4:* API Freeze
** New in this release: Projects must have defined a simple system test
for karaf distribution with recommended features installed
** New in this release: Projects must run the simple system test on Code
Merge (e.g. merge job), any upstream project Code Merge (e.g.
integration job), as well as Release Creation events, e.g., weekly, RC
and formal releases [1]
** Integration project must have jobs deploying multi-project karaf
editions, and running sanity test at least on Release Creation events

* *M5:* Code Freeze
** New in this release: Projects must have completed the system test for
each user-facing feature
** New in this release: Projects must run the user-facing feature system
tests on Code Merge (e.g. merge job), any upstream project Code Merge
(e.g. integration job), as well as Release Creation events, e.g.,
weekly, RC and formal releases [1]
** Integration project must have system test (ST) for multi-project
karaf editions complete and running at least on Release Creation event
(+2 wk offset)

[1] For projects running system test in external Lab:

* *M5:* Code Freeze
** New in this release: Projects running system test outside the
OpenDaylight CI infrastructure, do not need to run system tests on each
"-merge" and "-integration" Jenkins job, but should if they can. These
projects are required to report the results of external system test in a
timely fashion after Release Creation events, e.g., weekly, RC and
formal releases.
