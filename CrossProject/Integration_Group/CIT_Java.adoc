Currently we have 2 types of Java integration tests:

* Integration Test using PAX-EXAM framework to test a set of OSGi
bundles. Check OpenDaylight Controller:Integration Tests[Instructions on
Writing Integration Tests]
* Northbound Integration test for testing NB REST APIs. Check
OpenDaylight Controller:Northbound Integration Tests[Instructions on
Writing Northbound Integration Tests]

In addition we have 1 integration test job:

* Integration test job to re-build the code when changes on dependencies
are detected. Check GettingStarted:Jenkins Integration Job Setup[Jenkins
