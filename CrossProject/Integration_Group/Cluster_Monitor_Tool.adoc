== Cluster Monitor Tool

This tool provides real-time visualization of the cluster member roles
for all shards in the config datastore. This is useful in understanding
clustering behavior of controllers when they are in different roles and
states such as leader/follower, isolated, shutdown or rebooted. The tool
assumes that all cluster members have the same shards.

A file named 'cluster.json' contains a list of the IP addresses of the
controllers. It resides in the same directory as monitor.py. The login
credentials "user" and "pass" are not required for monitor.py, but they
may be needed for other apps in this directory. Since this file contains
configuration information unique to your environment, it may be a good
idea to stash it before performing git operations.

The 'cluster.json' file should look like this:

`   {` +
`       "cluster": {` +
`           "controllers": [` +
`               "172.17.10.93",` +
`               "172.17.10.94",` +
`               "172.17.10.95"` +
`           ],` +
`           "user": "username",` +
`           "pass": "password"` +
`       }` +
`   }`

[[usage]]
===== Usage

The file is located in test/tools/clustering/cluster-monitor/

$python monitor.py

[[starting]]
===== Starting

Before using, start and configure all controllers in the cluster. Usage
of the cluster deployer script is recommended. All controllers must
initially be running so that the tool can retrieve the controller and
shard names. Once the tool is started and the controller and cluster
shard names are retrieved, controllers can be isolated, shut down,
rebooted, etc.

[[user-interface]]
===== User Interface

Controller member names (not host names) are displayed across the top.
Shard names are displayed to the left.

In the upper left is a heart emoticon "<3" which toggles between yellow
and black backgrounds with each update. If a controller is down, the
http timeout comes in to play and updating becomes much slower. If the
heart is not blinking, some of the data may be stale.

The central matrix displays controller roles. When ReST queries fail,
the error type is displayed. Leader, Follower, and Candidate roles are
color-coded.

[[other-scripts]]
===== Other Scripts

isolate.py uses IPtables to isolate an indicated controller from the
cluster. The tool takes a single integer argument corresponding to the
number of a controller in the json file's ordered list of controllers.
This is the controller to be isolated. The 'cluster.json' file
containing a list of the IP addresses and credentials of the controllers
is required.

rejoin.py rejoins any isolated controllers to the cluster by flushing
the IPtables of all controllers. The 'cluster.json' file containing a
list of the IP addresses and credentials of the controllers is required.

timed_isolation.py isolates an indicated controller for a specified
duration. The tool's first integer argument corresponds to the number of
a controller in the json file's ordered list of controllers. This is the
controller to be isolated. The second argument is the duration of
isolation in seconds. The 'cluster.json' file containing a list of the
IP addresses and credentials of the controllers is required.

[[future-enhancements]]
===== Future Enhancements

* Add operational shards.
* Add a longer cURL time-out for initial retrieval of shard and member
names.
