[[lab-access]]
=== Lab Access

Shell access is granted to all Integration team committers. Others
needing access may make a request to the
mailto:helpdesk@opendaylight.org[OpenDaylight helpdesk] and provided the
Integration team committers ok the request access will be granted.

All users will have to be registered with the
https://identity.opendaylight.org[OpenDaylight Identity] system and also
have configured an SSH pubkey for their account in
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit[Gerrit].

The bridgehead system used to get to the lab allows for port forwarding,
if accessing from a Linux, Mac or BSD system you can use
https://github.com/apenwarr/sshuttle[sshuttle] for an easy VPN
experience. Users on Fedora can install it directly from yum. Ubuntu
users may be able to install from apt.

Using sshuttle to connect to the lab

code,bash----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
code,bash
# please replace $ODL_USERNAME with your username known to Gerrit

# Start sshuttle (you will need sudo rights on your system)
sshuttle -r $ODL_USERNAME@testlab.opendaylight.org 172.17.198.24/29 -H --seed-hosts test01,test02,test03,test04,test05

# in another terminal, connect to one of the 5 test systems
ssh $ODL_USERNAME@test01
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A few notes on sshuttle

* sshuttle runs as root, as such the .ssh/config file read will be the
one owned by root
* if you are not using an ssh-agent then the Identity that is used will
be read out of root's .ssh/ unless you've made a change to root's
.ssh/config file to point use the IdentityFile from a different location
