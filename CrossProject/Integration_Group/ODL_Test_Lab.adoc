=== Lab Access

As the Jenkins design has changed significantly and we are now operating
the lab out of Rackspace shell access has been removed. The reason for
this is that the Jenkins based tests are moving away from statically
built slaves to dynamically created ones. This makes it impossible to
grant shell access in a safe and sane manner.
