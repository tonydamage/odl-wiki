== Continuous Integration

OpenDaylight CI process is described on this
OpenDaylight_Controller:Development_Infrastructure_Overview[ link].
Tests are also part of the CI as shown in the picture below:

[[build-test]]
== Build Test

Build test occurs during project code build. Examples are Junit,
PAX-EXAM or single feature install test.

Every project in OpenDaylight defines 3 build jobs:

* Verify job -> builds the project code and passes build tests upon code
submit
* Merge job -> builds the project code and passes build tests upon code
merge. In addition it will upload generated artifacts to Nexus
repository.
* Integration job -> builds the project code and passes build tests
after a merge in an upstream project

[[system-test]]
== System Test

System test requires a distribution and an automation that installs the
controller and executes tests against network tools.

In this release we will provide a Jenkins job that installs controller
and runs a Robot test stored in the integration repository:

Every project in OpenDaylight will define 2 jobs:

* Distribution job -> builds the integration code and therefore the
official distribution
* System Test Jobs -> For every project user-facing feature (essential
functionality) we will create 2 system test jobs:
** feature-only test -> Installs single feature with required
dependencies and runs functionality planned test
** feature-all test -> Installs odl-integration-compatible-with-all +
feature and runs functionality planned test
