== Introduction

Pax-exam has proven to be a very fragile integration test mechanaism,
often failing because of changes that only impact pax-exam, and not the
actual system being tested.

== Proposed Solutions

1.  CONTROLLER-LEVEL-INTEGRATION: There is a controller-maven-plugin
coming in that should allow the running of integration tests in a real
running controller, rather than an artificial pax-exam environment:

https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/3420/[Gerrit 3420]. Thus
allowing for both more realistic and also more robust integration
testing.
