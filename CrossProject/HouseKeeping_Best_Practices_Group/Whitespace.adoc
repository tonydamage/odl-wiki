1.  *DEPENDENCY-INTEGRATION-TEST*: Have a test in the integration
project that fails whenever the contents of the plugin or lib directory
for a Release Vehicle acquires a new bundle that is not from
org.opendaylight.

This failure would precipitate a polite question to the project causing
it as to whether they were aware of they had introduce a new dependency
and whether they had given thought to whether it was necessary.

The same mechanism could be used to look for duplicates of dependency
versions in an attempt to encourage unintentional proliferation of
dependency versions (two different versions of the same depencency).
