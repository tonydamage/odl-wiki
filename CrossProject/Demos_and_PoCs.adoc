= Welcome to the OpenDaylight Demo and Proof Of Concept Staging Area

This page holds various demos and PoCs that are under construction or
have been created to highlight the capabilities of OpenDaylight in a
variety of settings.

[[dynamically-manage-multiple-virtual-networks-within-an-environmentdatacenter]]
== 1 - Dynamically manage multiple virtual networks within an
environment/datacenter

* Build an environment with multiple hosts on several virtual networks
using overlays or flows
* Assign and identify policy between the networks/hosts, include
inter-virtual-network connectivity ala route leaking etc.
* demonstrate the enforcement of policy
* Add/move/delete networks while all proper layer 3 routing behaviors
remain in tact
* demonstrate the connections and policies persist through the change of
the network
* Using BGP in addition to, or instead of, OpenFlow in managing the
network interconnections would be additionally interesting.
* Using OpenStack for some/all of the virtual hosts/storage would be
additionally interesting as well

=== Description / Notes / Issues

TBD - Use this section to share information across the the team…. ideas,
work tasks, issues that need resolution, etc

[[multi-vendor-fabric]]
== 2 - Multi-vendor Fabric

* This could be done by extending the IDOL demo given at ONS
* Use OF and OVSDB to set up virtual network
* Plumb additional physical network elements from different vendors and
show the resulting connectivity and traffic flow through the overlay and
underlay networks
* demonstrate connectivity and traffic flow

[[network-resiliency]]
== 3 - Network Resiliency

* Similar to what Rob Sherwood showed at ONS-2014
* Construct a small network with multiple controllers
* kill a switch, kill a controller/switch link, kill a controller, kill
multiple/all controllers
* Show other interesting failure cases and how the network
responds/recovers

network/component failure

[[dynamic-traffic-engineering-for-lanwan]]
== 5 - Dynamic Traffic Engineering for LAN/WAN

* Simulate multiple WAN connections with different costs/SLAs
** e.g. Research network for large data transfer, video gets high QoS,
secure tunnels on IPSEC, etc.
* Alter traffic flows based on time of day, bandwidth utilization or
other criteria (i.e. MPLS connection used at night for data backups)
* The goal is to demonstrate the dynamic balance between SLA and cost

[[dynamic-traffic-engineering-based-on-traffic]]
== 6 - Dynamic Traffic Engineering based on traffic

* DDoS is a good example of this. Need to put into demo form
* Analysis of traffic (switch/port stats, DPI, etc) causes dynamic
change to network
* demonstrate the trigger, the resulting change(s) due to the trigger
being tripped, and a return to “steady-state” once the issue causing the
trigger is mitigated.

[[blue-sky-demo---opendaylights-killer-use-case-is-central-control-of-dissimilar-vendor-network-elements]]
== 7 - Blue Sky Demo - OpenDaylight’s Killer Use Case is central control
of dissimilar vendor network elements

* Show desired SDN-type behaviors using multiple protocols to multiple
disparate network elements
* What can we come up with here?

[[cost-efficient-network-wide-dos-detection-and-mitigation]]
== 8 - Cost-efficient network-wide DoS detection and mitigation

Demonstrate how an SDN application (Defense4All) can utilize efficient
programmability of a heterogeneous network (controlled by OpenDaylight
controller) to

* 1) monitor traffic at different network points and detect DDoS
attacks, and
* 2) redirect traffic for mitigation (whether to local mitigation
devices or distant scrubbing centers).
