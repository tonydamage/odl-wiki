== Guidelines for Students

These ideas were contributed by our developers and users. They are
sometimes vague or incomplete. If you wish to submit a proposal based on
these ideas, you may wish to contact the developers and find out more
about the particular suggestion you're looking at.

Being accepted as an OpenDaylight Intern (either through the Google
Summer of Code program or other Internships available) is quite
competitive. Accepted students typically have thoroughly researched the
technologies of their proposed project and have been in frequent contact
with potential mentors. Simply copying and pasting an idea here will not
work. On the other hand, creating a completely new idea without first
consulting potential mentors is unlikely to work out as well.

If there is no specific contact given you can ask questions on the
general OpenDaylight development list dev@lists.opendaylight.org. See
the http://lists.opendaylight.org[OpenDaylight mailing lists page] for
information on available mailing lists and how to subscribe.

[[ideas]]
== Ideas

The following are running ideas for OpenDaylight Projects

[[md-sal-xmpp-jabber-bindings]]
=== MD-SAL XMPP (Jabber) Bindings

* *Title:* MD-SAL http://xmpp.org[XMPP] Bindings
* *Description:* The OpenDaylight controller is based on an MD-SAL
allows the modeling of data, rpcs, and notifications. Because of this
model basis, adding new northbound bindings northbound bindings to the
controller is simple, and everything modeled becomes exposed
automatically. Currently the MD-SAL has restconf NB bindings.
http://xmpp.org[XMPP (Jabber)] is an xml based messaging bus. This
project would involve adding http://xmpp.org[XMPP (Jabber)] bindings to
the MD-SAL, which would automatically make all MD-SAL APIs available via
that mechanism.
* *Additional Information:*
* *Desirable Skills:* Background in Java, Karaf, and XMPP would be
useful.
* *Expected Outcome:* A karaf feature that, when installed, exposed the
MD-SAL datatree, rpcs, and notifications via XMPP (Jabber).
* *Difficultly:* Medium
* *Mentors:* Ed Warnicke
* *Additional Contacts:* IRC: edwarnicke

[[md-sal-amqp-bindings]]
=== MD-SAL AMQP Bindings

* *Title:* MD-SAL http://www.amqp.org[AMQP] Bindings
* *Description:* The OpenDaylight controller is based on an MD-SAL
allows the modeling of data, rpcs, and notifications. Because of this
model basis, adding new northbound bindings northbound bindings to the
controller is simple, and everything modeled becomes exposed
automatically. Currently the MD-SAL has restconf NB bindings.
http://www.amqp.org[AMQP] is a messaging bus. This project would involve
adding http://www.amqp.org[AMQP] bindings to the MD-SAL, which would
automatically make all MD-SAL APIs available via that mechanism.
* *Additional Information:*
* *Desirable Skills:* Background in Java, Karaf, and
http://www.amqp.org[AMQP] would be useful.
* *Expected Outcome:* A karaf feature that, when installed, exposed the
MD-SAL datatree, rpcs, and notifications via AMQP.
* *Difficultly:* Medium
* *Mentors:* Ed Warnicke
* *Additional Contacts:* IRC: edwarnicke

[[improved-odl-meetbot]]
=== Improved ODL Meetbot

* *Title:* Extend the IRC meetbot to better meet ODL needs
* *Description:* Following most of the the other open source projects,
ODL runs many meetings via IRC and uses meetbot to take minutes. There
are several idiosyncrasies of how we use it that make it less effective
than we might like and thus lots of opportunities to Improve it. Some
ideas are:
1.  Add a new command for roll calls (#rollcall) to record who attended
the meetings. This is especially true for IRC meetings.
2.  Add timer support, e.g., for topics that sends warnings about when
we're running over time.
3.  Add a new command to put a #info (and maybe other commands) for the
last topic while we move on to the next topic.
4.  Add support for better tracking of action items across meetings,
also maybe the notion of recurring meetings.
* *Additional Information:* Provide links to bugzilla entries,
release-plan notes, and/or other web-references that would be helpful
information to potential interns.
** http://ci.openstack.org/meetbot.html[OpenStack Meetbot], which is
what we use
** https://wiki.debian.org/MeetBot[Debian Meetbot], which is what
OpenStack Meetbot is based on
* *Desirable Skills:*
** Python programming skills
** Experience with IRC
** Experience with DB tools, e.g., sqlite or others, to persist action
items and track recurring meetings
* *Expected Outcome:* A updated version of the meetbot which has new
commands, e.g., #rollcall, #lasttopic, #topic , etc.
* *Difficultly:* Easy
* *Mentors:* Colin Dixon
* *Additional Contacts:* #opendaylight-meeting, #opendaylight

[[dependency-and-version-tracking-tools]]
=== Dependency and Version Tracking Tools

* *Title:* Dependency and Version Tracking Tools
* *Description:* In OpenDaylight, projects depend on each other and
other third-party projects and depend on different versions of those
parts. Tracking who depends on what and what version and then
visualizing this in a way that helps us track cross-project issues will
be really helpful. This will likely include tasks like:
1.  Produce annotated dependency graphs at the project and bundle level
to understand what project depend on each other and how. Finding cycles,
especially new cycles as they come up, is one key part here.
2.  Track version skew. Understand when different projects or different
bundles are pulling in different versions of the same dependency. We
should be able have a report which says where this skew exists and maybe
even automatically periodically generates warnings for projects that are
lagging.
3.  Nice visualizations of this information (skew and dependency graphs)
would be amazing. Bonus points if we can provide a time slider to see
how things change over time.
* *Additional Information:*
** http://mojo.codehaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/[Maven Versions
Plugin], we've used this with mixed success in the past
* *Desirable Skills:*
** Java skills
** UI (likely web-based) skills to present the information
** Maven and pom file expertise
* *Expected Outcome:* Tools that provide dependency graph and version
skew information. Ideally in a nice web-based user interface.
* *Difficultly:* Medium
* *Mentors:* Colin Dixon
* *Additional Contacts:* Thanh Ha , Ed Warnicke

[[table-type-patterns-utilities]]
=== Table Type Patterns Utilities

* *Title:* Integrate the YANG model for Table Type Patterns with the
OpenFlow Plugin and Applications
* *Description:*
** Basically this project is to help make hardware OpenFlow support in
ODL actually work across different hardware without apps having to be
hard coded. So, you'd be working to make the original hardware OpenFlow
vision possible. For more vision, see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcaBS6w_k_o[this talk from the first ODL
summit].
** Currently the Table Type Patterns project provides support for
reading, writing and storing JSON- and XML-formatted descriptions of
switch functionality in the
https://www.opennetworking.org/images/stories/downloads/sdn-resources/onf-specifications/openflow/OpenFlow%20Table%20Type%20Patterns%20v1.0.pdf[Open
Networking Foundation's standard]. However, the project doesn't "do
anything" other than allow you to read in a TTP and associate it with a
switch. The next step is to flesh out APIs that make use of these Table
Type Patterns to do useful things. For example, automatic placement of
OpenFlow flows into the right tables based on the TTP and possibly
conversion between TTPs. Other examples are listed in this
https://docs.google.com/a/colindixon.com/document/d/1YwAvznNnU76ETMOpS7Z7b2qPvxExw0Mjnb3o0gqD8DA/edit[API

[[implement-a-secure-engineering-process-for-opendaylight]]
=== Implement a secure engineering process for OpenDaylight

* *Title:* Implement a secure engineering process for OpenDaylight
* *Description:* OpenDaylight has a security response team, able to
coordinate the release of patches for security issues that are
identified in the OpenDaylight code. However, no proactive measures to
minimize the number and extent of security issues in the code are in
place. This project involves implementing initial proactive security
measures for OpenDaylight. The community has already discussed this
problem and a clear plan for establishing a proactive secure engineering
process is available - you just need to execute it. The plan involves
the following key elements:
** Establish automated QE/CI jobs to catch security issues and
regressions. This will involve integrating the findsecbugs tool into
Gerrit/Jenkins.
** Establish automated QE/CI jobs to catch known-vulnerable
dependencies. This will involve integrating tools such as
dependency-check and victims into Gerrit/Jenkins.
** Document a threat model for OpenDaylight
** Improve documentation to capture security best practices at
installation and configuration time

[[openflow-e2e-performance-test-for-opendaylight]]
=== OpenFlow E2E Performance test for OpenDaylight

* *Title:* Create OpenFlow E2E performance test that runs in CI
* *Description:* We already have some tool [1] to measure OpenDaylight
E2E performance, these scripts can be used to estimate maximum flows can
be programmed per second using Northbound REST interface, making sure
flows are properly installed in Southbound device. We are looking for a
test to run in Continuous Integration (~ 10 mins long) that uses these
scripts to estimate the max flows/sec and stores this value in a CSV
file that can be later plotted by Jenkins. Since no test like this has
been performed in CI in the past I would expect 2 phases in this
project:
** Measurement: Familiarize with perf scripts, measure controller
performance, find issues, file bugs, etc...

[[longevity-test-for-opendaylight]]
=== Longevity test for OpenDaylight

* *Title:* Create longevity test for OpenDaylight
* *Description:* Today all our tests run in Continuous Integration which
means they do not take more than ~20 mins to pass. OpenDaylight needs a
test that runs for few hours or days to verify controller stability.
During the test we can try some controlled actions like adding removing
flows [1] but we can also use random events like [2]. Additionally we
should track things like CPU load, memory fill, controller logs, etc...
Since no test like this has been performed in the past I would expect 2
phases in this project:
** Measurement: Measure controller stability, find issues, file bugs,
etc...
** Automation: Program a longevity test that runs for few hours or days
and warns/reports on issues like CPU overload, memory full, logs errors,
flows not being programmed, etc...
