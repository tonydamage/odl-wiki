*Wiki and Continuous Evolution* – Documentation should be published to
http://wiki.OpenDaylight.org/ so any contributor can improve it

*Versioning* – We want the documentation to continue to improve even
after the bits are released but we need to make sure readers understand
what is available in various releases:

* If a feature will only be available in the next release indicate as
“Coming in Helium”
* If a feature is deprecated in a future release, indicate as
“Deprecated in Helium”

*Language* - The OpenDaylight project uses English as its primary
language but contributors are encouraged to translate into other
languages. If content is available in other languages, consider
providing hyperlinks at the top of the section (ex: “English | Hebrew |
Spanish”)

*Platforms* – Where possible, there should be a single set of
documentation for all platforms. If there is variance, this should be
described in parallel. For example:

* On Linux, …
* On MacOS, …
* On Windows, …

*Screenshots* – When possible, screenshots should vary (ex: Chrome on
MacOS, Firefox on Windows, etc.)

*Some style guidelines for headings* +
A compilation (from diverse sources) of generally accepted guidelines
for headings follows.

_Use_:

* Self explanatory, descriptive, and concise headings

::
  Preferred: Prerequisites for an AAA Service installation
  +
  Not preferred: Prerequisites

* Singular nouns in headings
* Sentence style capitalization: Capitalize the first word and proper
nouns in a heading.
* Gerunds for task topic headings

::
  Example: Installing the AAA Service

* Infinitives in task headings

::
  Example: Install the AAA Service or To install the AAA Service

* Nouns in concept and reference section headings
* Parallel construction
* Two or three headings in page-length content to create white space

_Practices to avoid when writing headings_

* Interrogative headings

::
  Example: What is the AAA Service?

* More than 3 levels of headings
* Skipped levels of headings

::
  Example: A Heading 3 cannot follow a Heading 1.

* "Stacked" headings: Ensure that there is text between one heading and
the next.
* "Widowed" headings: Headings that stand alone at the bottom of a page
while the related text

::
  appears on the next page

* Expanded acronyms: Use an acronym in a heading, and expand it when it
occurs next in the body text
* Articles at the beginning of headings: Avoid wherever possible

*Terms and definitions* +
Include a labeled list of terms and their definitions in content for
each ODL component (chapter) in the user guide. +
