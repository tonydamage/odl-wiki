== Introduction ==
Test Tools area is created with the aim of building the framework needed for system test development and execution.

== OpenDaylight Lab at Ericsson ==
The framework for Continuous System Integration Test will be hosted in existing OpenDaylight servers, in the meantime Ericsson offers a test environment that can be used for:

* Get familiar with controller (DUT)
* Evaluate test tools
* Debug system test code
 
=== Lab Access ===

Lab access is provided through SSH server with public key authentication. Please follow the steps bellow:
* Generate a public key in the SSH client and mail it to luis.gomez@ericsson.com along with your alias.
* Once the key gets provisioned in the SSH server, do: ssh alias@server2.verkstad.net (129.192.170.80). In case of authentication problems please contact luis.gomez@ericsson.com
* The SSH server allows SSH forwarding (SSH tunnels) so you can configure a many as you need (example to forward VNC: ssh -L 15900:10.125.136.37:5900 alias@server2.verkstad.net)
* Before start using the Lab, please '''book''' the time [[CrossProject:Integration_Group:Lab_Schedule|here]]
* The VM images have 2 intefaces: one for operation (external access) and one for traffic. Please use the second for doing test.

=== Test VMs ===
Following VMs are already available:

* Test Tools image
** Purpose: install/evaluate test tools
** System: CentOS 6.4 (64 bits), 2 Cores, 4 MB RAM, 40 GB HDD
** Interfaces: 10.125.136.37 for operation and 10.125.136.51 for traffic
** Access: SSH or VNC to 10.125.136.37 (odluser/odluser1) (root/odluser1)
** Applications: Firefox REST client

* Controller image
** Purpose: run controller (DUT)
** System: CentOS 6.4 (64 bits), 2 Cores, 4 MB RAM, 10 GB HDD
** Interfaces: 10.125.136.38 for operation and 10.125.136.52 for traffic
** Access: SSH to 10.125.136.38 (odluser/odluser1) (root/odluser1)
** Applications: OpenDaylight controller

* Mininet image
** Purpose: simulates OF switches
** System: Ubuntu 13.04 (64 bits), 1 Core, 1 MB RAM, 10 GB HDD
** Interfaces: 10.125.136.39 for operation and 10.125.136.53 for traffic
** Access: SSH to 10.125.136.39 (mininet/mininet)
** Applications: Mininet

=== Lab walkthrough ===
* Set up OpenDaylight controller:
1) Login into the controller (odluser/odluser1):
<pre>[ecelgp@SDC-SSH ~]$ ssh odluser@10.125.136.38
odluser@10.125.136.38's password: 
Last login: Fri Oct 18 17:39:47 2013 from ec-centos.ericsson-magic.net
</pre>

2) Download latest controller project OSGi package (if not there yet):
<pre>$ cd controller-project/
$ wget 'https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/controller/job/controller-merge/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/opendaylight/distribution/opendaylight/target/
distribution.opendaylight-osgipackage.zip'</pre>


3) Run the controller:
<pre>[odluser@odl-controller ~]$ ./controller-project/opendaylight/run.sh</pre>
