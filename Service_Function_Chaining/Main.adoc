Service Function Chaining provides the ability to define an ordered list
of a network services (e.g. firewalls, load balancers). These service
are then "stitched" together in the network to create a service chain.
This project provides the infrastructure (chaining logic, APIs) needed
for ODL to provision a service chain in the network and an end-user
application for defining such chains.

This project includes the following documents:

[[sfc-todo]]
== SFC TODO

* Finish the RPC interface (SfcProviderRPC). Today it is limited in
scope and which elements it exercises
* Integrate the config file bootstrap so the code is fully self healing
(High Priority)
* Iron out the JSON object to provision a SFF (see point below). This
will most likely be similar to SFF Yang model.
* _(Done)_ Implement REST API to communicate southbound with switch
front-end. This API will send the JSON object to the server that will
communicate with switches
* Integrate with dlux UI
* _(Done)_ Integrate the distribution POMs
* At some point move to the new DataListener APIs. Hopefully somebody
else will weed out the bugs.
* Change the Yang models to use leafrefs, idenityrefs and others when we
are confident it will not cause Data Deserialization errors.
* Harden the code
* SfcProvider*API classes need to be changed to Callable (maybe, need to
test with new DataBroker service)
* Integrate with LISP service
* Python regression tests
* _(Done)_ Fix windows line terminators
* Logback configuration for tracing messages
* SFF should be decoupled from path ID
