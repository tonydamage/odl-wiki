== How to test

For setup, as well as general SFC scenarios, please see the SFC wiki
page:
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Service_Function_Chaining:Main#SFC_101

Test cases:

* Create simple SFC configuration, with an SFG instead of SF. The SFG
will include only one SF, in order to test compatibility for the olds
scenario, with no SF grouping.
* Create a chain with an SFG that contains multiple SF’s, and a simple
SGF-Algorithm. Test that the Load-Balancing between the SF’s is done
properly.
* Repeat 1&2 with a chain that contain a mix of SF and SFG in the path
definition.
* Test different REST configuration calls: read\write\remove SFG from
DB, add\remove SF from SFG, read\write\remove SFG-Algorithm from DB.

[[description-1]]
== Description

In this section, please provide a detailed description of your project
feature including:

* Overview

When creating the Rendered Service Path, the origin SFC controller
chooses the first available service function from a list of service
function names. This may result in lots of issues such as overloaded
service functions and longest service path as SFC has no means to
understand the status of service functions and network topology. The
service function selection framework supports at least four algorithms
(e.g. Random, Round Robin, Load Balancing, Shortest Path) to choose the
most appropriate service function when instantiating the RSP. In
addition, it is an extensible framework that allows 3rd party algorithm
implementations to be plugged in.

* Design Architecture

The following figure illustrates the service function selection
framework and algorithms.

image:SF selector arch.png[SF selector arch.png,title="SF selector arch.png"]

User could use three different ways to select a service function
selection algorithm:

* ** Integrated RESTConf Calls. Openstack® or other administration
system could provide plugins to call the APIs to select a selection
algorithm.
** Command line tools. Command line tools such as curl could select
schedule algorithm by posting messages to RESTConf calls.
** SFC-UI. Now the SFC-UI provides an option for choosing a selection
algorithm when creating a Rendered Service Path.

RESTConf Northbound SFC API provides GUI/REST interactions for choosing
the service function selection algorithm. MD-SAL Datastore provides all
supported service function selection algorithms, and provides APIs to
enable one of the provided service function selection algorithm. Once a
service function selection algorithm is selected, the service function
selection algorithm will work when creating a rendered service path.

* Configuration

The random and round robin service function selection algorithm just use
the default REST configuration of the ODL SFC. These configuration could
be found at the folder:

*$\{SFC Repo}/sfc-jsonconfig/src/main/resources/bootstrap*

Notice: the configurations for Shortest Path and Load Balance algorithm
are to be updated soon.

(you can point to your project wiki if this information already exists
there)

[[bundles-1]]
== Bundles

In this section, enumerate software bundles (OSGi and not OSGi) that are
part of the feature

(You can just provide a link to the feature.xml file)

There is no bundle needed. But may be updated in the future.

[[upstream-dependencies-1]]
== Upstream Dependencies

In this section, state any dependency on features in the same or other
projects within Opendaylight

The service function selection algorithm depends on the following:

* ODL netconf plugin
* sfc-model
* sfc-provider
* sfc-sb-rest
* sfc-ui

[[downstream-dependents-1]]
== Downstream Dependents

In this section, state any feature or project that you know depends on
this feature

Currently there are no downstream dependencies

[[incompatibilities-1]]
== Incompatibilities

In this section, state any incompatibility you know on the same or other
projects features and the effect on your feature.

Please also note, if known, why the incompatibility exists as well as
any plans and discussions you have had about possibly resolving this
incompatiblity either during this release or in a future release.
Projects are encouraged to do this to improve the consumability of
OpenDaylight. Doing so, especially if it resolves incompatibilities will
be seen favorably as part of project maturity when advancing through the
http://www.opendaylight.org/project-lifecycle-releases[project
lifecycle].

Currently, there is no incompatibility.

[[network-intrusiveness-1]]
== Network Intrusiveness

Does your feature program devices, send flows, packets out, etc...
without any special setting or configuration?

The Service function selection algorithm doesn’t program any device, it
just generate rendered service path. Use the default JSON configuration
to store the service functions into datastore is the basic
configuration.

[[recommended-karaf-features-1]]
== Recommended Karaf features

In this section, state which features would you recommended to enable in
Karaf distribution to use and test your feature

* odl-netconf-all
* odl-sfc-core
* odl-sfc-ui

[[how-to-test-1]]
== How to test

To test the service function selection algorithm works as expected or
not, the default JSON configuration must be loaded, the JSON files are
listed in the folder:

*$\{SFC Repo}/sfc-jsonconfig/src/main/resources/bootstrap.*

Notice: if the sfc-ui module is not used for the tests, please refer to
the
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Service_Function_Chaining:Lithium_User_Facing_Features#SFCOFL2[SFCOFL2]
part to check how to use command line tools to load the JSON
configurations and to create the rendered service path.

Notice: The following two ways to choose the service function selection
algorithm are often used:

* Command line tools(including postman/restclient). In this case, the
following JSON content is needed:

Service_function_schudule_type.json

\{

` "service-function-scheduler-types": {` +
`   "service-function-scheduler-type": [` +
`     {` +
`       "name": "random",` +
`       "type": "service-function-scheduler-type:random",` +
`       "enabled": false` +
`     },` +
`     {` +
`       "name": "roundrobin",` +
`       "type": "service-function-scheduler-type:round-robin",` +
`       "enabled": true` +
`     },` +
`           {` +
`       "name": "loadbalance",` +
`       "type": "service-function-scheduler-type:load-balance",` +
`       "enabled": false` +
`     },` +
`   ]` +
` }`

}

Then execute the following command:

curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Cache-Control: no-cache"
--data Service_function_schudule_type.json -X PUT --user admin:admin
http://localhost:8181/restconf/config/service-function-scheduler-type:service-function-scheduler-types/

* SFC-UI. SFC-UI provides a drop box for service function schedule
algorithm.

Here is a snapshot for the user interaction from SFC-UI when creating a
rendered service path.

image:Karaf SFC deploy select a type.png[Karaf SFC deploy select a type.png,title="Karaf SFC deploy select a type.png"]

Notice: Some service function selection algorithms in the drop list are
not implemented yet. Only the first three algorithms are committed at
the moment.

Notice: the configuration for Shortest Path and Load Balance will be
updated later on.

[[test-case-random-service-function-selection-algorithm]]
==== Test Case: Random service function selection algorithm

* Purpose of the test
** This test verifies that the Random service function selection
algorithm works as expected.
* Pre-conditions or Pre-requisites
** The configuration mentioned above must have been loaded on an empty
system.
* Detailed Test Steps
** Run the Karaf with/without debug option

[[description-4]]
== Description

SFC-OVS provides integration of SFC with OpenVSwitch (OVS) devices.
Integration is realized through mapping of SFC objects (like SF, SFF,
Classifier, etc.) to OVS objects (like Bridge,
TerminationPoint=Port/Interface). The mapping takes care of automatic
instantiation (setup) of corresponding objects whenever it's opossite is
created. E.g. new SFF --create-- > OVS Bridge, new OVS Bridge --create--
> SFF, etc.

SFC-OVS uses OVSDB MDSAL Southbound API for getting/writing information
from/to OVS devices. The core functionality consists of two types of
mapping:

\a. mapping from OVS to SFC

* OVS Bridge is mapped to SFF
* OVS TerminationPoints are mapped to SFF DataPlane locators

\b. mapping from SFC to OVS

* SFF is mapped to OVS Bridge
* SFF DataPlane locators are mapped to OVS TerminationPoints

[[bundles-5]]
== Bundles

In this section, enumerate software bundles (OSGi and not OSGi) that are
part of the feature

(You can just provide a link to the feature.xml file)

$\{SFC Repo}/features-sfcofl2/src/main/resources/features.xml

[[upstream-dependencies-6]]
== Upstream Dependencies

The SFCOFL2 renderer depends on the following:

* OpenFlowPlugin
* sfc-model
* sfc-provider

[[downstream-dependents-6]]
== Downstream Dependents

Currently there are no downstream dependencies

[[incompatibilities-6]]
== Incompatibilities

In this section, state any incompatibility you know on the same or other
projects features and the effect on your feature.

Please also note, if known, why the incompatibility exists as well as
any plans and discussions you have had about possibly resolving this
incompatiblity either during this release or in a future release.
Projects are encouraged to do this to improve the consumability of
OpenDaylight. Doing so, especially if it resolves incompatibilities will
be seen favorably as part of project maturity when advancing through the
http://www.opendaylight.org/project-lifecycle-releases[project
lifecycle].

Currently the only incompatibility that I cant think of in SFCOFL2, is
that it only works with version 1.3 of OpenFlow.

[[network-intrusiveness-6]]
== Network Intrusiveness

Does your feature program devices, send flows, packets out, etc...
without any special setting or configuration?

The SFCOFL2 renderer does indeed send flows to OpenFlow Switches (OFS).
The OFS must be version 1.3, and can be started in mininet as follows:

* sudo mn --topo linear,4 --mac --switch ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow13
--controller remote,ip=192.168.1.103

[[recommended-karaf-features-5]]
== Recommended Karaf features

In this section, state which features would you recommended to enable in
Karaf distribution to use and test your feature

To use the SFCOFL2 feature in Karaf, the following features must be
enabled:

* odl-openflowplugin-all
* odl-sfc-core
* odl-sfcofl2

[[how-to-test-6]]
== How to test

[[how-to-setup-your-feature-test]]
=== How to setup your feature test

[[create-sfc-configuration]]
==== Create SFC Configuration

To test the SFCOFL2 feature, the configuration must be loaded as
follows. +
*Notice* the JSON messages are listed in the above configuration
section. +
*Notice* the order these messages are sent in is important.

* curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Cache-Control:
no-cache" --data '$\{SF.json}' -X PUT --user admin:admin
http://localhost:8181/restconf/config/service-function:service-functions/
* curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Cache-Control:
no-cache" --data '$\{SFF.json}' -X PUT --user admin:admin
http://localhost:8181/restconf/config/service-function-forwarder:service-function-forwarders/
* curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Cache-Control:
no-cache" --data '$\{SFC.json}' -X PUT --user admin:admin
http://localhost:8181/restconf/config/service-function-chain:service-function-chains/
* curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Cache-Control:
no-cache" --data '$\{SFP.json}' -X PUT --user admin:admin
http://localhost:8181/restconf/config/service-function-path:service-function-paths/

[[create-rsp]]
==== Create RSP

Once the configuration has been successfully created, the
RenderedServicePath (RSP) must be created via an RPC message, as
follows:

* curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Cache-Control:
no-cache" --data '$\{RSP.json}' -X POST --user admin:admin
http://localhost:8181/restconf/operations/rendered-service-path:create-rendered-path/

[[query-rsp]]
==== Query RSP

This command can be used to query the created RenderedServicePath (RSP)

* curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Cache-Control: no-cache"
-X GET --user admin:admin
http://localhost:8181/restconf/operational/rendered-service-path:rendered-service-paths/

[[delete-rsp]]
==== Delete RSP

This command can be used to delete the RenderedServicePath (RSP)

* curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Cache-Control:
no-cache" --data '\{"input": \{"name": "sfc-path1" } }' -X POST --user
admin:admin
http://localhost:8181/restconf/operations/rendered-service-path:delete-rendered-path/

[[how-to-execute-basic-test-cases-to-validate-the-features-functionality]]
=== How to execute basic test cases to validate the feature’s
functionality

Provide details of at least 3-7 system test cases which would allow your
feature to be tested at a minimum

[[test-case-rsp-correctly-created-normal-and-symmetric]]
==== Test Case: RSP correctly created (normal and symmetric)

* Purpose of the test
** This test verifies that the RenderedServicePath (RSP) is correctly
created.

* Pre-conditions or Pre-requisites
** The afore-mentioned configuration must have been loaded on an empty
system.
** Once the configuration has been loaded, the RSP must have been
created via RESTconf RPC, as detailed in the above configuration
section.

* Detailed Test Steps
** Once the RSP has been created, query the RSP, using the following
above curl command, or your preferred REST application.

* Expected Results
** Two RSPs should have been created
*** RSP: sfc-path1 - this is the uplink traffic RSP
*** RSP: sfc-path1-Reverse - this is the downlink, symmetric RSP
** The RSPs should be created with the JSON as can be found above in:
"Expected Rendered Service Path creation"

[[test-case-flow-tables-correctly-populated]]
==== Test Case: Flow Tables correctly populated

* Purpose of the test
** Verify that the SFCOFL2 renderer correctly programmed the flow
switches.

* Pre-conditions or Pre-requisites
** The above test case "RSP correctly created" has been executed.

* Detailed Test Steps
** Query the flows in the OpenFlow switches SFF1 (openflow:2) and SFF2
(openflow:3)

* Expected Results
** The flow tables contain the following: (TODO finish this)
*** sudo ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 dump-flows s2
*** sudo ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 dump-flows s3

[[test-case-simple-http-packet-traverses-the-service-chain]]
==== Test Case: Simple HTTP packet traverses the Service Chain

* Purpose of the test
** Verify that the SFCOFL2 renderer correctly programmed the flow
switches to allow a packet to traverse the Service Chain

* Pre-conditions or Pre-requisites
** The above test case "RSP correctly created" has been executed.

* Detailed Test Steps
** Ping the server from the client: h1 ping h4
** Start an HTTP server: h4 python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80 &
** Inject an HTTP message: h1 wget -O - h4

* Expected Results
** The client (h1) can successfully ping the server (h4)
** The Http client (h1) can successfully query the Web Server (h4) and
receives an HTTP response.

[[test-case-flow-tables-deleted-upon-rsp-deletion]]
==== Test Case: Flow Tables deleted upon RSP deletion

* Purpose of the test
** This test verifies that the flows in the Openflow switches are
deleted when the RSP is deleted.

* Pre-conditions or Pre-requisites
** The above test case "RSP correctly created" has been executed.

* Detailed Test Steps
** Once the RSP has been created, delete the RSP, using the following
above curl command, or your preferred REST application

* Expected Results
** All flow tables in SFF1 (openflow:2) and SFF2 (openflow:3) have been
deleted.

If your tests are already implemented in Robot, please provide the pybot
commands and robot scripts or repo. SFCOFL2 tests are not implemented in
Robot.
