[[externally-consumable-apis]]
== Externally Consumable APIs

* *SFF Load Balancing feature*
** This feature will enhance the existing SFC API
** The load balancing feature and Opendaylight communicate through the
SFC Southbound REST interface
** Bundles providing the API: sfc-sb-rest
** REST API commands include:
*** For Service Function Group (SFG): read existing SFG, write new SFG,
delete existing SFG, add Service Function (SF) to SFG, and delete SF
from SFG
*** For Service Function Group Algorithm (SFG-Alg): read, write, delete
*** Service Function groups and algorithms defined in: sfc-sfg and
sfc-sfg-alg

* *SFCOFL2* SFC OpenFlow Renderer feature
** This feature uses the existing SFC API and does not add anything
extra

* Classifier Control and Data Plane Impl
** This features exposes API to configure classifier (corresponds to
service-function-classifier.yang)

* *Southbound REST Plugin*
** Provides Southbound REST API designated to listening REST devices,
supports POST/PUT/DELETE operations on these data types:
*** Access List (ACL)
*** Service Function (SF)
*** Service Function Group (SFG)
*** Service Function Forwarder (SFF)
*** Rendered Service Path (RSP)

* *SFC OVS*
** Provides API to configure/control OVS through SFC
** Support for these device types:
*** Service Function Forwarder (SFF)
*** (to be done) Service Function (SF)
*** (to be done) Classifier

* *GBP + SFC Integration* Proof of Concept
** This integration is a proof of concept to be performed in the Lithium
time-frame. Post Lithium, this will be a "permanent" feature.
** In the sfc-rsp yang model, the following have been added for this PoC
*** rpc read-rendered-service-path-first-hop
*** rpc read-rsp-first-hop-by-sft-list
*** rendered-service-path-first-hop-info (used by the preceding 2 RPCs)

* *Service Function Selection Algorithms*
** Provides Service Function selection algorithms at RenderedServicePath
creation
** Currently supported algorithms:
*** Load Balancing (choose the least loaded SF)
*** Round Robin
*** Random
** Load Balancing part defined in: sf-desc-mon and sf-desc-mon-rpt

possible
* In case negative be aware you will be required to provide System Test
(ST) reports upon any release creation (weekly Release, Release
Candidate, Formal Release, etc...)
