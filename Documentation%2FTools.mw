The following instructions work with Mac OS X and (probably) Linux. Instructions for Windows clients are awaiting a volunteer.

= Getting Ready =
Before you begin this procedure, be sure to complete the following prerequisites: 
* Install [https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi Maven].
* Install the GitHub client: 
** [https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-linux Linux]
** [https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-mac Mac OS X]
** [https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-windows Windows]

==Git Cheat Sheet==
For a quick overview of Git commands, check out the [[GIT Cheat Sheet | Git Cheat Sheet]]. For more specifics, see below.

== Gerrit Setup ==
Creating a Gerrit account, including registering a public/private key pair, is required for using Git over SSH as documented below. Gerrit is also used for code reviews. If you don't already have an account with established keys, follow the documentation on [[OpenDaylight Controller:Gerrit Setup|setting up Gerrit]].

== Pull code via Git CLI ==
Pull the code by cloning the controller repository:
<pre>
git clone ssh://<username>@git.opendaylight.org:29418/docs.git
</pre>

Note that the command above assumes you've registered a Gerrit account and have a valid keypair for authentication. The public key should be known to Gerrit, and the private key should be on your local system at ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

If you just want to do an anonymous git clone, you can use HTTPS:
<pre>
git clone https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/p/docs.git
</pre>

== Setup Gerrit Change-id Commit Msg Hook ==
The following Git hook automatically inserts a unique Change-Id tag in the footer of each commit message. Git doesn't track hooks, so after pulling the project you'll want to go ahead and grab this one manually. Using this hook is optional, but highly recommended for tracking changes.

<pre>
cd docs
scp -p -P 29418 <username>@git.opendaylight.org:hooks/commit-msg .git/hooks/
chmod 755 .git/hooks/commit-msg
</pre>

= Installing and Editing ODL Documentation =
<ol>
<li> Change to the proper manuals directory and use the  '''mvn install''' command to compile the desired documentation. </li>
<li> Access the compiled guides at ''./manuals/install-guide/target/docbkx/webhelp/'' </li>
<li> Find ASCIIDoc formatting information here: ''http://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc'' </li>
</ol>

= Publishing ODL Documentation =
Under construction
