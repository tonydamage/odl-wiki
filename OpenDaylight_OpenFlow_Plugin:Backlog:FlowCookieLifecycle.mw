= Flow cookie usage =
Cookie value is ignored by switch and can be used by controller to identify flow. Switch identifies flow by tableId, priority and match.

* flow statistics (flow statistic response contains flow cookie)
* flow management (in dataStore there is id, name and cookie)

= Flow management =
Flow can be added, removed or updated by:
* changing data in config context of dataStore (= managed by '''FRM''')
* invoking corresponding action programmatically (= managed by application)
* invoking corresponding action via restconf (= managed by application)

Flows managed by application should be ignored by FRM.

== FRM management ==
FRM is invoked through dataChange notification after new flow is written into config context of dataStore.
