= Flow cookie usage =
Cookie value is ignored by switch and can be used by controller to identify flow. Switch identifies flow by tableId, priority and match.

* flow statistics (flow statistic response contains flow cookie)
* flow management (in dataStore there is id, name and cookie)

= Flow management =
Flow can be added, removed or updated by:
* changing data in config context of dataStore (= managed by '''FRM''')
* invoking corresponding action programmatically (= managed by application)
* invoking corresponding action via restconf (= managed by application)

Flows managed by application should be ignored by FRM.

== FRM management ==
FRM is invoked through dataChange notification after new flow is written into config context of dataStore.
So in case the device is available, FRM does following:
* check the <font color="green">mapping</font> in order to find flow cookie (sent to device previously)
* if not found we have '''new flow'''
** ignore cookie value in config if any
** generate unique cookie for the flow
** store generated cookie in <font color="green">mapping</font> <flow.id, cookie>
** invoke flow service provider rpc (OFPlugin) using generated cookie
* if found we have '''existing flow''' - update (or remove)
** invoke corresponding rpc

<font color="green">Mapping</font> will be stored in operational context (under table/cookieMapping)

== Flow cookie mapping ==
Mapping is needed while creating, updating and deleting of flow - having flowId the cookie on device can be found.

In case of statistics there is flow cookie from device available and corresponding flowId could be found.
