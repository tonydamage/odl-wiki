= Meters : Test Provider =

Currently, the openflowplugin has a test-provider that allows you to push various flows through the system from the OSGI command line.  Once those flows have been pushed through, you can see them as examples
and then use them to see in the config what a particular flow example looks like.

== AddMeter : addMeter ==

Run the controller by executing:
<pre>
cd openflowplugin/distribution/base/target/distributions-openflowplugin-base-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-osgipackage/opendaylight
./run.sh
</pre>

Point your mininet to the controller by giving the parameters --controller=remote,ip=<IP address>.

Once you see your node (probably openflow:1 if you've been following along) in the inventory, at the OSGI command line try running:
<pre>
addMeter openflow:1
</pre>
You can now confirm that meter has been created on the switch.

== RemoveMeter : removeMeter ==

Run the controller by executing:
<pre>
cd openflowplugin/distribution/base/target/distributions-openflowplugin-base-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-osgipackage/opendaylight
./run.sh
</pre>

Point your mininet to the controller by giving the parameters --controller=remote,ip=<IP address>.

Once you see your node (probably openflow:1 if you've been following along) in the inventory, at the OSGI command line try running:
<pre>
removeMeter openflow:1
</pre>
The CLI takes care of using the same meterId and nodeId as used for meter add. You can confirm that it was removed from the switch.

== ModifyMeter : modifyMeter ==

Run the controller by executing:
<pre>
cd openflowplugin/distribution/base/target/distributions-openflowplugin-base-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-osgipackage/opendaylight
./run.sh
</pre>

Point your mininet to the controller by giving the parameters --controller=remote,ip=<IP address>.

Once you see your node (probably openflow:1 if you've been following along) in the inventory, at the OSGI command line try running:
<pre>
modifyMeter openflow:1
</pre>
The CLI takes care of using the same meterId and nodeId as used for meter add. You can confirm that it was modified on the switch.
