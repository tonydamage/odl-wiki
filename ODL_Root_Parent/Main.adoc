[[introduction]]
= Introduction

ODL Root Parent provides common settings for all the projects
participating in simultaneous release. ODL Root Parent Project contains
a POM that includes common external dependencies, distribution
management, plugin management, repository information etc that is common
to all the projects. This pom has only defaults which other projects
will inherit if the defaults are not specified.

ODL root parent sits on top of all the projects participating in
simultaneous release.

* Having this top level parent helps us isolate all the common external
dependencies, default version, dependency management, plugin management
etc without having to duplicate them for each project.
* Each project now has it's root parent inheriting all the defaults from
ODL root parent.
* Project level external dependencies and the ODL version can be
overridden if necessary.
* With the ODL root parent project, we can have uniform tagging across
all the projects
