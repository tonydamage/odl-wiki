=Current Status=
Brief of the current statistics collection module (Statistics-Manager) is present [[https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_OpenFlow_Plugin:Statistics|here]]

Current implementation sends all statistics collection request to all the connected node at the same time. This results in flooding of response from all the connected nodes and causing CPU spikes as well as stressing MD-SAL operational data store.

=Ideas for improvement=
Current approach is not scalable and has performance issues. To reduce statistics collection resource consumption and make it more scalable 

* Dynamic stats polling interval based on the number of connected nodes and number of entries in the respective tables (Flow tables, Group, Meter ]
* For each connected node spread out stats polling throughout the stats collection interval
* Only start stats collection after the previous collection of the stat has finished (i.e. do not be timer-driven)
* Different periodic interval for each statistics type
** Flow statistics is crucial compared to aggregate flow stats
*** Keep the initial periodic interval High for low priority statistics
*** and make it adaptive according to amount of data received in response
