Notes:
* Doc Books is needed for generating professional-looking documentation (ePub, PDF, HTML) but XML authoring is challenging
* ASCII Doc is very similar to MediaWiki formatting
* Ideally, authoring can be done in ASCII Doc and then can be run through a tool chain to generate Doc Books
* In OpenStack, it was useful to be able to submit a doc bug when reading docs
* First step: Setting-up pipeline 
* Eventually: put 301 redirects on wiki pages
* Paul will set-up an IRC area for the group to get together
