== oDCS ==
After compiling the odcs, go to the "build" directory, type "dcs_server.py".
"dcs_server.py" is the starting script. The list of parameters will be
shown if the incorrect number of parameters are entered.

=== Running with "TEMORARY" CLI ===
A CLI has been provided on the oDCS. This CLI allows the user to configure DOVE objects such as domains, networks (vnids), subnets i.e. configuration that would be typically done by the DMC. The CLI has 2 modes of operation:
# Privileged mode: This allows user to enter configuration data
# Non-privileged mode: For viewing data (read only)

Start the CLI:
<pre>
./build/dcs_server.py <udp_port>
</pre>

Sample Output:
<pre>
dove@dps-64:~/odcs$ ./build/dcs_server.py 12345
DCS HTTP Server started on Port 1888
Password:
</pre>

Password for privileged mode: Hook&Ladder
Password for non-privileged mode: Any other string
