== Introduction ==
The OVSDB Plugin project is an overlay Network Virtualization project that leverages other critical open source projects, OpenStack and Open vSwitch and integrates into them producing a controller driven framework for policy instantiation and operational management.

| align="left" | OVSDB Plugin Library: Redesigned OVSDB Library
| The library can be used separately by any Java OVSDB implementation to help serve as a reference implementation.
|-align="left"
| align="left" | Implement a strong CI framework
| Avoid developer downtime, reduce software bugs and increase the quality of the final deliverable
|-align="left"
| align="left" | OVSDB plugin/Neutron: Implement various NXM extensions:
| Upstream extensions Openflowlibrary project in order to leverage necessary extension to develop OpenStack services in the OVSDB Neutron integration.
|-align="left"
| align="left" | Integrate OpenStack Security Groups and Rules 
| First of many OpenStack Neutron service integration. This will consolidate Port security functionality into the OVS network forwarding pipeline rather then the IP Tables Linux daemon.

| To facilitate traditional non-overlay fabric integration.
|-align="left"
| align="left" | Persitance OpenFlow v1.3 Storage Across Controller Reloads
| Recover from a controller failure and restore consistency with OpenStack and Open vSwitch without interuption to existing provisioned resources.
|-align="left"
| align="left" | Continue to be a Community Driven Project. 
| Ensure the Community made up of open source developers and network operators and engineers always have as much input and decision making in the spirit of Open Source Software.
