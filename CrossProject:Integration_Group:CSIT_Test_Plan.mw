** save configuration (i.e. POST http://10.125.136.52:8080/controller/nb/v2/switchmanager/default/save)

* Topology Manager (Builds network topology) 
** show Topology (i.e. GET http://10.125.136.52:8080/controller/nb/v2/topology/default)
** list user links (i.e. GET http://10.125.136.52:8080/controller/nb/v2/topology/default/userLinks)
** add user Link (i.e. PUT http://10.125.136.52:8080/controller/nb/v2/topology/default/userLink/link1 with body text), list again and get topology
** remove user Link (i.e. DELETE http://10.125.136.52:8080/controller/nb/v2/topology/default/userLink/link1) and list again and get topology

* ARP Handler (Handles ARP messages)
** list subnets (i.e. GET http://10.125.136.52:8080/controller/nb/v2/subnetservice/default/subnets)

** ping on mininet (i.e. h1 ping -c 3 h4), verify it works
** show hosts (i.e. GET http://10.125.136.52:8080/controller/nb/v2/hosttracker/default/hosts/active)
** delete subnet gateway (i.e. DELETE http://10.125.136.52:8080/controller/nb/v2/subnetservice/default/subnet/test)

* Host Tracker (Tracks connected hosts) 
** add static hosts 
** ping on mininet (i.e. h1 ping -c 3 h4), verify it works
** show hosts (i.e. GET http://10.125.136.52:8080/controller/nb/v2/hosttracker/default/hosts/active)
** delete static hosts (i.e. DELETE http://10.125.136.52:8080/controller/nb/v2/subnetservice/default/subnet/test)
