==What is PAX-Exam==

Pax exam is an OSGi testing framework that allows specific bundles to be activated together to write integration tests.  While stand-alone JUnit tests can only cover the logic within a single bundle, the integration tests will handle the bundle dependencies to provide more complete system testing.

==Creating Integration Tests==

'''Maven pom changes'''






==Integration Testing Coverage Results==
After the test is in the repository and the next sonar run is completed, the integration test coverage percentage can be seen.  In this example, StatisticsManager had 28.9% coverage from JUnit testing, and the integration tests were able to get a complete 100% coverage.
