Attendees: Basheer, Sharon, YuLing, Mohnish

* The team discussed about the TSDR distribution issue on windows based
on the fact that HBase does not work well on windows. The conclusion was
that we’re going to attempt incorporating an embedded data store that
runs well both on Windows and Linux in Lithium time frame. This will
also help with validating of TSDR pluggable architecture.
* Basheer initiated the idea of incorporating an embedded data store for
TSDR and volunteered to work on a POC for the embedded data store –
Thanks Basheer!
* YuLing is going to check in the TSDR Persistence Service code by the
end of today so that Basheer could pick it up for reference of
introducing another data store.
* Basheer and Sharon are going to continue/speed up on Data Collection
related tasks given the new task about introducing another data store.
