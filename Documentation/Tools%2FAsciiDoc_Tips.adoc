[[common-errors]]
== Common Errors

For each common Error you will find:

1.  Examples of the wrong way and right way to do something
2.  If they break the build, what they look like when they break the
build, so you can figure out which one you have
3.  How to fix them

[[you-cant-have-a-bare-image]]
=== You can't have a bare image

So, this is broken:

----------------
image::foo.png[]
image::bar.png[]
----------------

but this is fine

----------------------------
.a title for the image
image::foo.png[]

.a title for the other image
image::bar.png[]
----------------------------

file:/Users/ckd/git-reps/docs/manuals/developers-guide/target//target/generated-docs/bk-developers-guide.xml-invalid.xml

to see all the errors in context. 
You must correct the errors in the original 
source DocBook or wadl files however.

You can control whether build fails or not by 
setting failOnValidationError to no in your pom. 

lineNumber:  3945; columnNumber: 16; element "mediaobject" not allowed yet; expected element "info", "title" or "titleabbrev"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[fixing-it]]
==== Fixing it

You can open the file (in this case
`/Users/ckd/git-reps/docs/manuals/developers-guide/target//target/generated-docs/bk-developers-guide.xml-invalid.xml`)
and go to the line and column to see what reference needs to be fixed.
You can also just search for all instances of image:: and see if you see
one that looks wrong, i.e., doesn't have a title right above it.

[[watch-widths-and-heights-on-big-images]]
=== Watch widths and heights on big images

A page is about 500 wide and 750 tall, so you might have to do things
like this:

---------------------------
.title for wide image
image::wide.png[width=500]

.title for tall image
image::tall.png[height=750]
---------------------------

If you also want to have alt text, you need to make sure to put in
double quotes. So, this is wrong:

----------------------------------------
.title for wide image
image::wide.png[Alt text here,width=500]
----------------------------------------

This is right:

-------------------------------------------
.title for tall image
image::tall.png["Alt text here",height=750]
-------------------------------------------

[[fixing-it-1]]
==== Fixing It

Add a `width=` to the square brackets after the image.

[[referencing-sections-is-annoying]]
=== Referencing sections is annoying

The thing you reference is gotten by taking the title, making it all
lowercase, replacing non-alphanumeric characters with _ and adding a
leading _. See the
http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/userguide.html#_section_ids[actual
reference] on this behavior for more info.

So, if you have section called "OpenFlow Plugin:Mininet", you reference
it like:

----------------------------
<<_openflow_plugin_mininet>>
----------------------------

You can have different text for the link like this:

------------------------------------
<<_openflow_plugin_mininet,Mininet>>
------------------------------------

[[referencing-sections-in-the-same-doc-using-anchor-notation]]
==== Referencing sections in the same doc using anchor notation

To mark a location the doc, so it can be referred by another section of
the document, to this

* Mark Place by adding anchor using notation
+
---------
[[label]]
---------
* Refer to anchor at any place in the doc
+
--------------
<<label,text>>
--------------

Example:

------------------------------------------------------
[[blabla]]
This is a place in the doc you want to refer to later.

text
...
text
Click <<blabla,here to go back to marked>> location.
------------------------------------------------------

to see all the errors in context.

You can control whether build fails or not by 
setting failOnValidationError to no in your pom.

lineNumber:  49; columnNumber: 146; IDREF "_installing_components" without matching ID
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[fixing-it-2]]
==== Fixing It

You can open the file (in this case
`/Users/ckd/git-reps/docs/manuals/developers-guide/target//target/generated-docs/bk-developers-guide.xml-invalid.xml`)
and go to the line and column to see what reference needs to be fixed.
You can also just search for all things in double angle brackets
(<<...>>) to see if you can find it.

[[complicated-table-stuff-seems-to-fail]]
=== Complicated table stuff seems to fail

For example this formats the text in a single, really tight column:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[cols=*3,^,options="header",width="75%"]
|===
| Artifact ID | Component | Description
| openflowplugin | openflowplugin | Main implementation of OFPlugin
| openflowplugin-it test-provider drop-test test-scripts | test | Support for end-to-end, integration, and regression testing
| openflowplugin-controller-config | configSubsystem | Default configuration files for config subsystem
| distributions-openflowplugin-base | distribution | OFPlugin distribution, based on  the distribution of the controller,
but the old (OF-1.0 only) plugin is replaced with the new plugin(OF-1.0+1.3)
| learning-switch sample-consumer | sample | Sample  projects demonstrating MD-SAL usage
| vagrant | util | Materialize testing virtual machine containing mininet+ovs
|===
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

But this works fine:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[options="header"]
|===
| Artifact ID | Component | Description
| openflowplugin | openflowplugin | Main implementation of OFPlugin
| openflowplugin-it test-provider drop-test test-scripts | test | Support for end-to-end, integration, and regression testing
| openflowplugin-controller-config | configSubsystem | Default configuration files for config subsystem
| distributions-openflowplugin-base | distribution | OFPlugin distribution, based on  the distribution of the controller,
but the old (OF-1.0 only) plugin is replaced with the new plugin(OF-1.0+1.3)
| learning-switch sample-consumer | sample | Sample  projects demonstrating MD-SAL usage
| vagrant | util | Materialize testing virtual machine containing mininet+ovs
|===
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[fixing-it-3]]
==== Fixing It

Just remove all the things in but `options="header"` in the square
brackets above the table.

[[missing-images]]
=== Missing Images

If you don't put your images in the `src/main/resources/images`
directory in the right manual things won't build. For the developer's
guide, that would be
`manuals/developers-guide/src/main/resources/images/`.

[[build-error-looks-like-2]]
==== Build Error Looks Like

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[fixing-it-4]]
==== Fixing It

Either:

1.  the file name is wrong in the asciidoc
* look if there is a similar file in the `src/main/resources/images`
directory and see if it seems like the right file
* sometimes it's as simple as having .png instead of .jpg or the other
way around
2.  the file is missing
* find the file and include it, often this involves reaching out to the
person who wrote the docs or the docs contact for the project in
question

[[you-cant-have-empty-sections]]
=== You can't have empty sections

You can't have an empty section.

This is fine:

---------------------
== Section One Header
Some text here.

== Section Two Header
More text here.
---------------------

This is not:

---------------------
== Section One Header
// no text here

== Section Two Header
More text here.
---------------------

[[build-error-looks-like-3]]
==== Build Error Looks Like

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
lineNumber:  12243; columnNumber: 11; element "section" incomplete; expected element "address", "anchor", "annotation"...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[fixing-it-5]]
==== Fixing It

Simply add some content to the section. Typically this happens while
writing outlines and just adding "TBD" or "TODO: Add text describing..."
is the right approach.
