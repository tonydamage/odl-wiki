<li><b> Code names for the first simultaneous release</b>
* The votes are in.  The winner is "Hydrogen"
<br />
li><b>Election of new TSC members</b>
* TSC Charter: "The TSC members are the project leads from the Core projects.  There is only one project lead per project."
* No projects in Core state
* Do we (the TSC) wish to forego elections of new TSC members on October 8th, 2013 and instead wait until such a time that one or more projects have reached the "Core" state?
* If no, then 
** The Charter could be changed to include other states besides "Core" projects (such as Mature and possibly BootStrap)... or even Incubation depending on the intent of the TSC.  This type of change would require both the TSC and Board approval
** Some of the projects currently in Bootstrap (and possibly Incubation) could apply for Mature (and possibly Core) status prior to the October 8th timeframe if they felt ready.  ** Note that the lifecycle calls for a 2 week review period prior to each TSC review.  This will affect the scheduling of the reviews and any resulting elections from project promotions to Core.
