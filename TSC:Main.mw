== Meeting Agenda ==
The next TSC meeting is scheduled for Thursday, July 11 at 10:00am PDT.  Agenda topics: 
<li> <b>Agenda Bashing/Administrivia</b>
* Acceptance of minutes
<br />

<li> <b>Hackfest planning/awareness </b>
* O(30) people signed up
<br />

<li> <b>Committer Status</b>
* Assuming we have no more project proposals come in between now and Oct. 8th, and no individuals are graduated from contributor to committer status (note Mr. Sarath Babu G from NEC for VTN)
* The demographics of committers looks like this: 
** 54 total committers 
** 19 from Cisco (spread across three projects) 
** 14 from NEC 
** 8 from IBM 
** 4 from Radware 
** 3 from BSN 
** 3 from ConteXtream 
** 1 from Pantheon * VTN committers 

* Mr. Sarath Babu G as a committer (VTN)
** [http://www.opendaylight.org/project/tsc/charter Section 7 of the TSC Charter]: "Committer rights are earned via code contribution and community trust.   Committers select and vote for new Committers, subject to TSC approval.  A standard meritocracy model with new Committers will be approved and implemented by the TSC which will include provision for fully open code submission, review, acceptance, build, test, delivery, and support model." 
<br />
<li> <b>Disposition of the net-virt project</b>
* The committers from BSN have become inactive 
* If net-virt is to continue as a Boot-Strap project, we should find and appoint some active committers.   
* If not, we should push the project to "archive". 
<br />

<li> <b>TSC Charter states that to be on the TSC an individual must be voted as a project lead of a "Core" project</b>   
* We will probably have very few, if any Core projects by Oct. 8th.   
* In general, we need our projects to be actively seeking more diversified committers 
<br />
 
<li> <b>Participation in the "Infrastructure "work stream"</b>  
* There is thus far no traction there and our ability to bring all these new projects in, and get them built and tested correctly and efficiently is going to take focused effort.   
** Our community continues to be focused on adding features when the core code and CI infrastructure still need a lot of work.   
* We (the TSC) are responsible for calling out the gaps and soliciting  participation.   

<br />
<li> <b>TSC Charter Deliverables:</b>
<li> <b>Deliverable 1:</b> Section 4 of [http://www.opendaylight.org/project/tsc/charter TSC Charter] 
* "The active Committers will elect a number of TSC members; <b>the exact number to be determined by the TSC after the organization is formed</b>. In order to ensure a true community is in place prior to election, these TSC community seats will be elected six months after the organization forms.  These elected community seats must be filled with individuals from separate, unaffiliated companies." 
** How many active committers/project on the TSC? 
* "The TSC will serve as ODP's liaisons with other consortiums and groups." 
** Liaisons: IETF, ETSI, ONF, OpenStack, SDN Academy, OpenCompute Project, ON.Labs/ONRC, and OMG
** Others?
* VTN committers 
** Mr. Sarath Babu G as a committer 
** [http://www.opendaylight.org/project/tsc/charter Section 7 of the TSC Charter]: "Committer rights are earned via code contribution and community trust.   Committers select and vote for new Committers, subject to TSC approval.  A standard meritocracy model with new Committers will be approved and implemented by the TSC which will include provision for fully open code submission, review, acceptance, build, test, delivery, and support model." 

<li> <b>Deliverable 2:</b> Section 6 of [http://www.opendaylight.org/project/tsc/charter TSC Charter] 
* "The TSC will establish the Development Process for ODP and present the Development Process to the Board for approval." This includes 
** <i><b>Cleanliness</b></i> of code base 
** <i><b>Ample and diverse Contributors and Committers</b></i> to assure vitality of the project. 
** <i><b>Stability</b></i> (e.g., presence of test suites and use of an appropriate source-code control system). 
** <i><b>Predictability</b></i> of releases 
** <i><b>Alignment</b></i> with ODP's goals. 
<li> <b>Deliverable 3:</b> Section 6 of [http://www.opendaylight.org/project/tsc/charter TSC Charter] 
* "The Development Process will include provision for a voting process to be implemented for decision making in accordance with the following guidelines:" See [http://www.opendaylight.org/project/tsc/charter Section 6 of the TSC Charter] 
<li> Other Charter deliverables?
