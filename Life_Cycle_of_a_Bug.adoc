This page provides an overview of the life cycle for a bug.
Specifically, it defines the general process one follows from opening a
bug to finally closing the bug after having fixed the issue.

This is the life cycle in detail.

[[you-found-a-bugissue]]
==== You found a bug/issue

1.  You find a bug or issue that needs to be addressed!
* Hopefully you have discussed with others on IRC or via the
Distribution Lists.
2.  Search for an existing bug on
https://bugs.opendaylight.org/[bugzilla]
3.  If you don't find an existing bug, then create a new bug

[[you-are-ready-to-work-a-bug]]
==== You are ready to work a bug

1.  Search for the bug on https://bugs.opendaylight.org/[bugzilla].
2.  Assign it to yourself, and change the state to "In progress".
3.  Develop your change, and commit them to
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/[gerrit].
* Please link to the Bug in commit message by using "Bug \{$id}" in
commit message. Eg. "Bug 1: Fixed typo in comment."
* _Make sure that if you are not ready for review on your first commit
that you make that clear in the subject_
4.  When your bug is ready update it state in bugzilla to
"WAITING_FOR_REVIEW", which clearly signals bugfix is submitted.
* Address any jenkins build failures
* Wait for a committer on your project to review the code changes
** Reach out via IRC if time is pressing, otherwise wait and a committer
will look at the source. +
_Committers for each project are on the right hand side of their home
wiki page._
* A committer will review and provide comments on the source.
* Address any comments from the committers
* Repeat as necessary
5.  A committer will give a +2 and merge / deliver the changes into the
master.
6.  Assuming the jenkins build passes, the gerrit ticket will be closed
out automatically (moved to "Merged" state).
7.  You (the developer) closes out the original
https://bugs.opendaylight.org/[bugzilla] ticket.
