=== Goals ===

====Use Cases====
* list of *key* use cases
** each use case should link to its behavior diagram (see Dynamic Model section below)

==== Functional ====
* describe any functional requirement not captured by a use case, otherwise put "None."

==== Non-Functional ====
* min/max limits, etc.


=== Design ===

==== Static Model ====
* interface
** link to yang file
** screenshot of GUI, if one exists
* structure
** component diagram capturing key relations
** state machine of activity diagrams for key state variables

==== Dynamic Model====
* list of behavior diagrams  (there should be one for each use-case listed above)
** image (UML sequence diagram or communication diagram)
