'''Thursday Apr24'''
* Agenda
AGENDA:

1. Helium Release Plan:
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Simultaneous_Release:Helium_Release_Plan

2. Actions from last week:

'''Repository/Endpoint:'''
* alagalah and readams1 to work on a date for date
* Target to have a skeleton structure by next week's Monday

'''Datastore''':
No actions but RegXBoi feels we have enough to start building a Yang model from the UML Model (alagalah agrees)

'''Operational State'''
* alagalah and regxboi to discuss putting this meeting on hold until we have something to operationalise in the Status meeting
* alagalah to confirm in Status meeting that charter is indeed instrumentation and ensuring proper operational aspects are included in subgroups

'''Renderer:'''
* Meeting on hold until readams/alagalah get a strawman prototype built. Need to decide on what to render (Affinity seems interesting? Rather than OF/OVSDB) and everything else is static.
