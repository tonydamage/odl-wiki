== Introduction ==
We plan to use Jenkins to trigger distributions and packages buils as well as perform system test (CSIT).

== Jenkins goals ==

* Build the release vehicles whenever we have new distribution code or opendaylight code
* Run system test whenever we have new test code, distribution code or opendaylight code
* System test bed has always latest successful test code and controller artifacts
* We do not upload release artifacts to Nexus if they do not pass system test

Using the tool, we found two bugs in the current base edition, [https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=136 bug #136] and [https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137 bug #137].

Currently, the code is hosted at [https://github.com/yeasy/CSIT_Test Github], welcome for any contribution.

== Prerequisites ==
* Linux based OS
* Java 1.7+
* Python 2.6/2.7 environment
