== Introduction ==
We plan to use Jenkins to trigger distributions and packages buils as well as perform system test (CSIT).

== Jenkins Strategy ==
This is what we would like to achieve in Jenkins:

=== Jenkins goals ===
* Build the release vehicles whenever we have new distribution code or opendaylight code
* Build the linux packages (Debian, Feadora) whenever there is new packaging code
* Run system test whenever we have new test code, distribution code or opendaylight code
* Run package test whenever there is new packaging code
* System test bed has always latest successful test code and controller artifacts
* We do not upload release artifacts to Nexus if they do not pass system test

=== Jenkins triggers and tasks ===
 
* Trigger 1) New patch in /distributions folder ->  
Verify tasks: build distributions, update controller VM (just made artifacts), run system test

* Trigger 2) Patch merged in /distributions folder ->  
Merge tasks: build distributions, update controller VM (just made artifacts), run system test, upload release artifacts to Nexus

* Trigger 3) New patch in /packaging folder ->  
Verify tasks: build package, update package to controller VM, run package test

* Trigger 4) Patch merged in /packaging folder ->  
Merge tasks: build package, update package to controller VM, run package test, upload package artifacts to Nexus
 
* Trigger 5) New patch in /test folder ->
Verify tasks: run system test (use Gerrit branch)

* Trigger 6) Patch merged in /test folder ->
Merge tasks: run system test (use Gerrit branch)
 
* Trigger 7) Change (merge) in other OpenDaylight project ->
Integration tasks: build distributions, update controller VM (just made artifacts), run system test (use Master branch), upload release artifacts to Nexus

=== Jenkins task distribution ===

* Master Jenkins running in OpenDaylight: distributions and packages build
* Slave Jenkins running in our test tools VM: run system test
* Slave Jenkins running in controller: update controller VM, run package test

=== Jenkins jobs ===

* Distribution Verify
* Distribution Merge
* Packaging Verify
* Packaging Merge
* Test Verify
* Test Merge
* Integration. We might need 1 job/project.
* System Test (CSIT) to run in test tools slave Jenkins. 
* Update controller VM to run in controller slave Jenkins
* Package Test to run in controller slave Jenkins
