== Introduction ==
We plan to use Jenkins to trigger distributions and packages buils as well as perform system test (CSIT).

== Jenkins goals ==
This is what we would like to achieve in Jenkins:
* Build the release vehicles whenever we have new distribution code or opendaylight code
* Build the linux packages (Debian, Feadora) whenever there is new packaging code
* Run system test whenever we have new test code, distribution code or opendaylight code
* Run package test whenever there is new packaging code
* System test bed has always latest successful test code and controller artifacts
* We do not upload release artifacts to Nexus if they do not pass system test

== Prerequisites ==
* Linux based OS
* Java 1.7+
* Python 2.6/2.7 environment
