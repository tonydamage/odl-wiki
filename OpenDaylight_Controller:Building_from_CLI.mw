In order to build the controller project from CLI, the following requirement must be met:
* Use JDK 1.7+ (Note the code is actually compiled to be compliant with Java 1.6 but if you use the JDK 1.6 there is a good chance to run into: <JDK bug>)
* Use Maven 3+
* Build machine must be connected to Internet (i know seems such a trivial requirement, but it's better to spell it out, this is needed because Maven build tool will need to retrieve the build tools from the repositories and also the project is dependent on third-party artifact that are stored in a maven repository)

Once this tools are installed then to build the project you need to:
# Go to the distribution directory available under opendaylight/distribution
# Pick the distribution to build, usually the one needed is opendaylight but the distribution directory is structured in such a way that multiple distributions can be hosted in the same place.
# Go under the selected distribution and run the command: mvn clean install
# Either:
#* Run the controller from the target directory
#* Pick the zip file and deploy in a separate machine
