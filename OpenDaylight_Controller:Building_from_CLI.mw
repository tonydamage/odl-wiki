In order to build the controller project from CLI, the following requirement must be met:
* Use '''JDK 1.7+''' (Note the code is actually compiled to be compliant with Java 1.6 but if you use the JDK 1.6 there is a good chance to run into: <JDK bug>)
* Use '''Maven 3+'''
* Build machine must be connected to Internet (i know seems such a trivial requirement, but it's better to spell it out, this is needed because Maven build tool will need to retrieve the build tools from the repositories and also the project is dependent on third-party artifact that are stored in a maven repository)

Once this tools are installed then to build the project you need to:
# Go to the distribution directory available under ''opendaylight/distribution''
# Pick the distribution to build, usually the one needed is ''opendaylight'' but the distribution directory is structured in such a way that multiple distributions can be hosted in the same place.
# Go under the selected distribution (most likely ''opendaylight'') and run the command: '''''mvn clean install'''''
# Either:
#* Run the controller from the target directory
#* Pick the zip file and deploy in a separate machine

''NOTEs''
* Maven build tools especially first time is launched will download many packages from the maven repository, so it will take a while depending on the connection speed. After first build many build packages are locally cached so build gets significantly faster.
* Maven build may run out of PermGen depending on the number of artifacts built, this is usually the case when building the ''opendaylight'' distribution for this the PermGen need to be increased. In order to do this and to make permanent the changes set in the environment the following environment variable: <br> '''MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m"'''<br> syntax for setting varies on the OS used by the build machine
