==Hydrogen Service Provider Edition User Guide==

The user guide should be the home for documentation on: Overview and Architecture, Configuration, Tutorial / How-To, Web/GUI, CLI, and Console.  It should link out to: Installation, APIs, and Release Notes

===Overview and Architecture===
The Service Provider edition of OpenDaylight is designed for network operator use. It does not include OVSDB, VTN or DOVE, but does include SNMP, BGP-LS, PCEP, and LISP southbound and the Affinity Service and the LISP Service northbound. The following diagram shows OpenDaylight Service Provider edition architecture in details:

===Installation Guide (link)===
The installation instructions for Service Provider Edition can be found [https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Release/Hydrogen/Service_Provider/Installation_Guide here].

===Installation Troubleshooting (link)===
A hyperlink to a list of troubleshooting steps for installation of the edition

===Configuration===
* In order to configure OpenDaylight Virtualization edition using OpenFlow 1.3 plugin, start Opendaylight Controller with ''-of13'' option. Otherwise, it will use the OpenFlow 1.0. 

* To start mininet for OF13 simulation for example do: ''mininet> sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=a.b.c.d --topo tree,2 --switch ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow13'' 

* To start mininet for OF10 simulation for example do:  ''mininet> sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=10.125.136.52 --topo tree,2''

==SNMP4SDN==

===Overview and Architecture===
* Current SDN technology is usually assumed to be based on network infrastructures using OpenFlow switches. Actually, SDN is not limited to OpenFlow, for example OpenDaylight SAL can support multiple southbound protocols. To fulfill the scope of underlying switches supported in OpenDaylight, Ethernet switches should also be considered. Commodity Ethernet switches have the advantage of low price and is programmable to some extent (i.e. using CLI and SNMP to modify the ACL, MAC table, forwarding table, etc). In an SDN built on commodity Ethernet switches, the upper layer applications could be responsible for making all the forwarding decisions for each switch, and the switches execute data plane forwarding as assigned. Therefore, we believe that commodity Ethernet switch has its advantage and warrants a position in SDN technology development. Off-the-shelf commodity Ethernet switches are commonly allowed to be configured by SNMP, and the Ethernet switch can actively report its status to the administrative computer (i.e. OpenDaylight controller) using SNMP trap. Therefore, we propose an SNMP southbound plugin to control underlying devices supporting SNMP using off-the-shelf commodity Ethernet switch. In addition to SNMP support, this plugin will provide capabilities to manage configurations that can only be accessed via CLI, e.g. ACL, disabling flooding, etc., since such configurations are necessary for using Ethernet switches for SDN. Therefore, there will be three phases in this project, as follows. (1) Creating an SNMP SouthBound Plugin: to configure Ethernet switches via SNMP. (2) The plugin configures Ethernet switches via CLI, for settings that SNMP cannot access. (3) SAL extension: for (1) and (2) we will contribute extensions to the SAL configuration APIs to provide additional API to support SNMP and CLI usage as specified above.
