== Introduction == 

This is a Simultaneous Release Plan for OpenDaylight.  
Projects may choose to participate or not based upon their readiness and desire to join the Simultaneous Release.
This plan is structured as laid out in the  [http://www.opendaylight.org/project-lifecycle-releases Project Lifecycle]

== Requirements for Participation ==

# Planning
## Projects must declare their intent to participate in the Simultaneous Release by M1.
## Participating projects must publish a candidate Release Plan by M1 and declare their Release Plan by M2
### Participating project Release Plans must contain Milestones that minimally line up with the Simultaneous Release Plan Milestones
# Modularity
## Modules that are not intended to interface with the controller via REST/other rpc mechanism must be OSGI bundles
## OSGI bundles should be reasonably granular
# Quality
## As part of Gerrit/Jenkins verification participating projects must run their build,unit tests, and project local integration tests at time prior to participation declaration
## As part of the Gerrit/Jenkins merge process participating projects must push their binary artifacts to the Nexus repo at time prior to participation declaration



== Milestones & Release Candidates ==

Milestones are spaced 4 weeks apart.

Release Candidates (RC) are spaced 1 week apart
