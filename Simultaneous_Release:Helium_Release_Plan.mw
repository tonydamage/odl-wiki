== Introduction == 

This is a Simultaneous Release Plan for OpenDaylight.  
Projects may choose to participate or not based upon their readiness and desire to join the Simultaneous Release.
This plan is structured as laid out in the  [http://www.opendaylight.org/project-lifecycle-releases Project Lifecycle]

== Requirements for Participation ==

# Planning
## Projects must declare their intent to participate in the Simultaneous Release by M1.
## Participating projects must publish a candidate Release Plan by M1 and declare their Release Plan by M2
### Participating project Release Plans must contain Milestones that minimally line up with the Simultaneous Release Plan Milestones
# Modularity
## Modules that are not intended to interface with the controller via REST/other rpc mechanism must be OSGI bundles
## OSGI bundles should be reasonably granular
# Quality
## No later than M3, each project must have a Jenkins Job which rebuilds and retests to an appropriate level when a project it depends on publishes new artifacts ('''Continuous Integration Test Start''')
## No later than M2 as part of the Gerrit/Jenkins merge process participating projects must push their binary artifacts to the Nexus repo.
# Code Hygiene
## No uses of System.out.println in non testcase code.
## No dependencies on 3rd party (non-ODL) snapshot versions

== Packaging, Tests and Documentation Expectations ==

As part of the simultaneous release there are some expectations on what projects should provide to facilitate packaging, tests and documentation. 

Please see [[Simultaneous_Release:Project_Expectations|Project Expectations]] for information about what is expected from projects to facilitate the simultaneous release.
r

== Aspirations and Intentions ==

There are certain things we would like to achieve procedurally for the Helium Release that we are not in a position to require because they are not yet worked out.
In order to provide a stable set of expectations they will not be required, but will be *strongly* encouraged as the details of how to achieve them are worked out.

# Continuous Release - The automated cutting of a regular set of release artifacts from each project (expected to be weekly).
# Continuous Documentation - The ongoing updating of documentation and its automatic assembly in the hopes of always being in a state of being documented

Note: The mechanics of how to achieve these aspirations are being worked out, and are expected to be figured out early in the Helium cycle, but are not yet known.

== Milestones, Release Candidates, and Service Releases ==

Milestones are spaced 4 weeks apart.

Release Candidates (RC) are spaced 1 week apart

Service Releases are roughly 6 weeks and 12 weeks (holiday adjusted) after the Formal Helium Release.

Please note that the TSC reserves the right to allow projects to enter the Simultaneous Release for a reasonable period of time after the M1 date. 

For example, the TSC may allow additional time if a project is delayed by the IPR Review process.

Please also note that projects that may be splitting into logical parts may have those logical parts join the Simultaneous Release at any point prior to M3 provided
their Release Plans are apportioned between the projects they split into.

Participating projects should list themselves here prior to M1, with a link to their Project wiki page, Release Plan as well as primary contact information.

== Decision on the Use of Karaf for Feature Selection Within Helium ==
The projects participating in the Helium simultaneous release need to decide if we are using Karaf for feature selection or not.  This decision impacts all projects that are part of the release so each project must commit to supporting Karaf if we are to use it in Helium.  All Project Primary Contacts are requested to provide their plan for supporting Karaf in the spreadsheet below by July 30th, 2014. <br>

== Communication Channels == 

=== Mailing List ===

release@lists.opendaylight.org is the formal channel for communication about the Simultaneous Release.

=== Per project Simultaneous Release Contact ===

Each project participating in the Simultaneous Release should designate a committer to be the contact for that project for that Simultaneous Release

=== Cross Project Milestone and Release Candidate Reporting ===

Negative status needs to be reported promptly.  If a project is under threat of, or does miss an element on its Release Plan, it should report that as soon as it becomes aware.

Positive Status need to be reported by each project at each Milestone Reporting status for that Milestone or Release Candidate.  Information would include things like pointers to 
continuous integration Jenkins Jobs, etc.

It is the responsibility of each projects Simultaneous Release Contact to report both positive and negative statuses.

=== Simultaneous Release Developer Meetings ===

One week prior to each Milestone or Release Candidate starting at M1, an IRC meeting for developer interested in the Simultaneous Release should be organized for real time coordination
and checkin.  The Simultaneous Release Contact for each project (or their delegate) should minimally be in attendance.

==== Developer Meeting Schedule ====
* M3 - Wednesday 7/9/2014  8:30am PST on #opendaylight-meeting 
* M4 - Wednesday 7/30/2014 8:30am PST on #opendaylight-meeting
* M5 - Wednesday 8/27/2014 8:30am PST on #opendaylight-meeting
* RC0 - Wednesday 9/3/2014 8:30am PST on #opendaylight-meeting

* RC2 - Wednesday 9/17/2014 8:30am PST on #opendaylight-meeting

=== Bugs ===

Bugs should be filed in [https://bugs.opendaylight.org/ Bugzilla]
