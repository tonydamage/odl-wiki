=How to install and run OpenDaylight and Mininet locally on your Windows laptop=

==Prerequisite:==
* The below assumes you have installed Java on your local machine
Java can be downloaded from: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html, http://www.azulsystems.com/products/zulu, and potentially other locations

==Install VirtualBox:==
* Download from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
* Run VirtualBox installer (VirtualBox-4.3.6-91406-Win.exe) 
* Accept all defaults to install
 
==Install Mininet appliance into VirtualBox:==
* Download it from https://github.com/mininet/mininet/downloads  (Remember to unblock the .zip file before unzipping)
* Unzip the mininet virtual appliance (mininet-2.0.0-113012-amd64-ovf.zip) 
* Run VirtualBox
* Select File -> Import Appliance
* Select mininet-vm.ovf from the unzipped mininet appliance folder
* Accept all defaults and complete import
* Start the mininet VM
* Use the following credentials to log into mininet: 
** Username: mininet
** Password: mininet
 
==Install and run OpenDaylight:==
* Download from http://www.opendaylight.org/downloads
* Unzip distribution.opendaylight-osgipackage.zip 
* Start a command window and run:
** cd opendaylight
** run.bat
* This will start the OSGi environment and load up all the plugins required to run OpenDaylight. It will take a minute or so to get fully initialized.
* Open a web browser window and navigate to: http://localhost:8080
* Log into OpenDaylight using the credentials:
** Username: admin
** Password: admin
* Once logged in, create a subnet / gateway using the OpenDaylight UI for 10.0.0.254/24
* Open a new command window (Start | Run | cmd.exe) and run the following command:
** ipconfig
* Determine your localhost IP address (e.g. 10.0.0.14)
* Execute the following command inside the mininet. Specify the above IP address in the command below:
** sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=10.0.014,port=6633 --topo tree,2
* This will start a mininet network with a tree topology of level 2 and connect to the opendaylight controller.
* Inside the mininet shell, execute the following command:
** pingall
* Some of the pings may fail the first time, but if you run pingall again, all of them should succeed
* Switch back to the web browser and refresh to see the topology created in mininet


=How to install and run OpenDaylight and Mininet in Windows Azure=

==Prerequisite:==
* The below assumes you have a Windows Azure subscription
* You can get a free subscription with $200 credit from: http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=AA4C1C935

==Instantiate and run a Linux VM with mininet inside Windows Azure:==
* We will use the VM image containing mininet on Ubuntu in VM Depot to instantiate a Mininet VM. 
* Follow the instructions here to instantiate a mininet VM: http://vmdepot.msopentech.com/Help/Help.cshtml#deployingUsingAUX 
* In the above steps, when asked to select the image to deploy, use the MininetOnUbuntu image here: http://vmdepot.msopentech.com/List/Index?sort=Featured&search=mininetonubuntu
* Also note that you will need to generate an SSH key so you can connect to the VM via putty. 
** Instructions for generating SSH key are at: http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/documentation/articles/linux-use-ssh-key/

==Instantiate and run a Windows VM with OpenDaylight inside Windows Azure:==
* Go to the Azure management portal: http://manage.windowsazure.com
* Sign in with your Azure account credentials 
* Click on Virtual Machines in the left column
* Click on New
* Click on Compute -> Virtual Machine -> Quick Create
* Select the Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter image
* Fill in appropriate details for the VM to be created
* Click on Create Virtual Machine
* Once the machine is created, click on it
* Click on Endpoints and add TCP endpoints 8080 (for the web UI) and 6633 (for controller)
* Click on Dashboard
* Click on Connect
* Open a remote desktop session using the .rdp file that will get downloaded to your machine and the credentials you specified when creating the VM
* Once you are in the remote desktop session, download the Java installer and run it
* Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the JRE folder
* Open ports 8080 and 6633 in the Windows firewall
* Download the OpenDaylight Hydrogen release to the machine and unblock and unzip it
* Open a command window and run
** cd opendaylight
** run.bat
* Open a browser and go to http://localhost:8080
* Login using the credentials:
** Username: admin
** Password: admin

==Connect Mininet to the OpenDaylight controller:==
* Open up a putty session into the Mininet VM created earlier
* Login using the SSH key and the credentials you had provided during the Mininet VM creation
* Run the following command, after replacing the remote controller ip address with the ip address of the Windows VM created above:
** sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=<public ip address of OpenDaylight vm>,port=6633 --topo tree,2
* This will start a mininet network with a tree topology of level 2 and connect to the OpenDaylight controller
* Inside the Mininet shell, execute the following command:
** pingall
* Some of the pings may fail the first time, but if you run pingall again, all of them should succeed
* Come back to the browser and refresh to see the topology created in Mininet


=How to install and run OpenDaylight and mininet on a Hyper-V server=

==Prerequisite:==
The following steps must be executed on a Windows Server with Hyper-V role enabled (or Windows 8 Pro or better).

==Create Mininet VHD for Hyper-V==
* Download the mininet ovf file from https://bitbucket.org/mininet/mininet-vm-images/downloads/mininet-2.1.0-130919-ubuntu-13.04-server-amd64-ovf.zip
* Download Microsoft Virtual Machine Converter from http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34591
* Use the mvdc.exe from the above tool to convert the Mininet OVF into Hyper-V VHD format
** MVDC.exe mininet.ovf mininet.vhd

==Install and run OpenDaylight on the Hyper-V host itself:==
* Download OpenDaylight from: 
* Unzip distribution.opendaylight-osgipackage.zip
* Start a command window and run:
** cd opendaylight
** run.bat
*This will start the OSGi environment and load up all the plugins required to run OpenDaylight. It will take a minute or so to get fully initialized. 
* Open a browser window and navigate to: http://localhost:8080
* Log into OpenDaylight using the credentials:
** Username: admin
** Password: admin
* Start Control Panel -> Network and Sharing Center -> Windows Firewall -> Advanced Settings -> Inbound Rules -> New Rule
** Add an exception for port 6633 so mininet can connect to the controller

==Create and Initialize a Mininet VM in Hyper-V==
* Start Hyper-V Manager
* Click on Virtual Switch Manager and create an Internal switch
* Open a new command window and run the following command:
** ipconfig
* Determine the IP address of the internal switch you just created (e.g. 10.0.0.14)
* Click on New -> Virtual Machine to create a new virtual machine with all default values
* Select the Internal switch created earlier for connecting to the virtual machine
* Select the Mininet VHD created earlier as the virtual disk for the VM
* Once the VM is created, select it and click on Connect
* Click on Start button in the VM console to start the VM
* Login with:
** Username: mininet
** Password: mininet
* Enable Hyper-V Modules using the following commands (http://www.isummation.com/blog/installing-ubuntu-server-1104-64bit-on-hyper-v/):
** sudo nano /etc/initramfs-tools/modules
** Add following lines to the file:
*** hv_vmbus
*** hv_storvsc
*** hv_blksvc
*** hv_netvsc
** Ctrl+X and save and exit the editor
** sudo update-initramfs  -u
** sudo reboot
* Login to the VM again after reboot
** sudo -s 
* Assign a static IP address to the ethernet adapter of the VM (http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/961.how-to-install-ubuntu-server-10-04-in-hyper-v.aspx):
** sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
** Add following lines to the file:
*** auto eth0
*** iface eth0 inet static
*** address  <ip address of the internal switch>
*** netmask 255.255.0.0
** Ctrl+X and save and exit the editor
** sudo reboot
* Check if the ethernet port specified above got the IP address assigned in the previous step:
** ifconfig
* Start mininet and connect to the remote controller using:
** sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=<ip address of the internal switch> --topo tree,2
* This will start a mininet network with a tree topology of level 2 and connect to the OpenDaylight controller.
* Inside the mininet shell, execute the following command:
** pingall
* Some of the pings may fail the first time, but if you run pingall again, all of them should succeed
* Come back to the browser and refresh to see the topology created in Mininet
