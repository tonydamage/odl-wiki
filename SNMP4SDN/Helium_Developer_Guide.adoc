=== Overview

We propose a southbound plugin that can control the off-the-shelf
commodity Ethernet switches for the purpose of building SDN using
Ethernet switches. For Ethernet switches, forwarding table and ACL are
where one can install the flow configuration on, and this is done via
SNMP and CLI in the proposed plugin. In addition, extensions to the SAL
configuration APIs are needed to provide additional API to support some
settings, e.g. disabling STP and flooding, etc, which are required for
Ethernet switches in SDN.

[[architecture]]
=== Architecture

The modules in the plugin are depicted as the following figure.

image:snmp4sdn_modules.jpg[snmp4sdn_modules.jpg,title="snmp4sdn_modules.jpg"]

*Figure. Modules in the SNMP4SDN plugin*

* FlowProgrammerService: to add/modify/remove flows on the switches.
* ReadService: to acquire the flow's or switch's or port's statistics.
* InventoryService: to acquire the switches’ and their ports’
properties.
* DiscoveryService: to probe and resolve the underlying switches as well
as the port pairs connecting the switches. The probing is realized by
SNMP queries. The updates from discovery will also be reflected to the
TopologyService.
* TopologyService: to query and acquire the switches' topology.
* ConfigService: to do kinds of vendor-specific proprietary settings on
switches
** Supported vendor-specific proprietary settings, such as: to disable
kind of flooding (BPDU flooding, broadcast flooding, multicast flooding,
and unknown flooding), disabling source mac check and source learning,
and setting SNMP host and community.
* VLANService: to create VLAN and set VLAN ports as well as read the
VLAN configurations on the switches

For the services above, when they need to read or configure the
underlying switches via SNMP or CLI, these queries are dealt with the
modules SNMPHandler and CLIHandler which directly talk with the
switches.

[[design]]
=== Design

In terms of the architecture of the SNMP4SDN plugin’s features, the
features include flow configuration, topology discovery, proprietary
configuration, statistic retrieving, and switch/port property
retrieving. Their architectures are as follows.

[[flow-configuration]]
==== Flow configuration

FlowProgrammer implements the SAL API, IPluginInFlowProgrammerService.
FlowProgrammer is in charge of listening to the flow given from upper
layer and pass it to the MessageReadWriteService, which maintains
command sending queue of the specific switch, and then SNMPHandler or
CLIHandler will be called to send the command out to the switch.
(SNMPHandler is to handle configurations on forwarding table, which can
be done via SNMP, CLIHandler is to handle configurations on ACL)

*Figure. Flow configuration*

[[vlan-configuration]]
==== VLAN configuration

VLANService implements the extended SAL API, IVLANService. VLANService
is in charge of allowing the request of creating VLAN and set VLAN ports
on switch, and then call SNMPHandler to send the command out to the
switch.

[[topology-discovery]]
==== Topology discovery

A topology consists of the elements, including switches, ports, and
edges. For the switches, in the plugin’s initialization, given a switch
list (a switch list database file), the plugin’s core would create a
SwitchHandler instance for every switch, and inform each SwitchHandler
of the new switch. As for the ports of every switch, the plugin’s core
uses SNMPHandler to query the number of ports on the switch, and inform
the corresponding SwitchHandler of the new ports. As for edges, upon
informed of new port, SwitchHandler calls DiscoveryService to read LLDP
data on the switch, so the edges are finally resolved.

[[new-switch-detection]]
==== New switch detection

Ethernet switches were not designed to behave like OpenFlow switches to
proactively connect to the controller, since in tradition it is not
assumed to have a central controller above. Therefore, the approach for
Ethernet switch to proactively notify the controller of its existence
could be: using SNMP trap. That is, every Ethernet switch is (1)
configured with its SNMP host (i.e. the controller’s IP address) and (2)
configured to send SNMP trap when the switch boots up. (1) and (2) are
supported in general and needs to be configured manually via CLI for
only once. In this way, the controller will know a switch joining in,
when receiving the switch’s SNMP trap of booting up.

*Figure. Switch discovery by means of SNMP trap*

[[proprietary-configuration]]
==== Proprietary configuration

To enable generic Ethernet switch to become SDN device, functions for
decentralization purposes, such as broadcast flooding, source learning,
etc, needs to be disabled. Especially, these functions are usually
configured via CLI. As the figure below, ConfigService exposes all the
proprietary functions to users, and from the user input, it retrieves
the switch’s IP address and port number to CLIHandler. Then CLIHandler
uses then IP address and port number to translate out a CLI command
string. This string is passed to ExpectHandler to send to the switch.
With this architecture, for different Ethernet switch products,
developers only need to rewrite the vendor-specific CLI command strings
in CLIHandler.

*Figure. Proprietary configuration*

[[statistic-retrieving]]
==== Statistic retrieving

ReadService is in charge of listening to the query from upper layer, and
passes the request to the StatisticMangager with the target switch’s ID,
then the specific SwitchHandler calls CLIHandler to query the switch for
statistics.

*Figure. Statistic retrieving*

[[switchport-property-retrieving]]
==== Switch/port property retrieving

InventoryService is in charge of listening to the query from upper layer
and call CLIHandler to request the switch for properties.

[[test-the-code]]
== Test the code

* Hardware is required: a subnet consisting of real Ethernet switches.
* For the first time to test the code,
SNMP4SDN:Installation_Guide#Manual_modifications_to_the_code[ manual
modifications to the code] is required, then
SNMP4SDN:Installation_Guide#Unit_test[ unit test] will automatically
proceed when building the code, and plugin test

[[manual-modifications-to-the-code]]
=== Manual modifications to the code

\1. Edit the :File:SwitchDB.txt[switch_login_db.csv] (located at
snmp4sdn/snmp4sdn/src/test) for the Ethernet switches. (Note that the
first line is title and should not be removed)

\2. In CmethUtil.java, modify the file path to switch_login_db.csv.

\3. For all xxxTest.java files under the subdirectories of
snmp4sdn/snmp4sdn/src/test, remove the mark in front of "@Test" so that
the tests will proceed when building the code.

\4. In these xxxTest.java files, the MAC address given to input to
addNewSwitch() should be consistent with that in switch_login_db.csv,
otherwise the program cannot know the mapped IP address and so on.

[[programmatic-interfaces]]
== Programmatic Interface(s)

* The SAL APIs SNMP4SDN plugin currently has implemented are listed
below.
* The usage note is also remarked.

[[interface-iplugininflowprogrammerservice]]
==== Interface IPluginInFlowProgrammerService

* Status addFlow(Node node, Flow flow)
* Status modifyFlow(Node node, Flow oldFlow, Flow newFlow)
* Status removeFlow(Node node, Flow flow)
* *[Note]:* for the Flow object in the APIs above,
** The 'Match' field in the Flow: only 'Ethernet Type'
(MatchType.DL_TYPE), 'Destination MAC Address' (MatchType.DL_DST) and
'VLAN ID' (MatchType.DL_VLAN) are effective. If any other field is given
value, this Flow would be regarded as a flow configuration on ACL, and
so far this capability is under implementation.
** The 'Action' field of the Flow: only 'Assign output port'
(ActionType.OUTPUT) is effective. If any other kind of action is given,
this Flow is regarded invalid.

[[extended-interface-ivlanservice]]
==== Extended Interface IVLANService

IVLANService is extended API, proposed by SNMP4SDN project, for VLAN
configurations.

* Status addVLAN(Node node, Long vlanID, String vlanName)
* Status setVLANPorts (Node node, Long vlanID, List nodeConns)
* Status deleteVLAN(Node node, Long vlanID)
* List getVLANPorts(Node node, Long vlanID)
* VLANTable getVLANTable(Node node)
** VLANTable is a table of VLANTableEntry; a VLANTableEntry is composed
of VLAN ID (an integer value) and VLAN port list (an integer array).

[[interface-ipluginintopologyservice]]
==== Interface IPluginInTopologyService

* void sollicitRefresh()
** now can effectively retrieve the topology maintained the plugin
