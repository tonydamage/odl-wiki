[[architectural-issues]]
== Architectural Issues

* The new switch detection is designed to be that the SNMP4SDN plugin
would be informed if receiving the coldstart/warmstart SNMP trap sent
from the switch, but it is possible that the trap gets lost (before this
issue has complete solution, one can reboot the switch as a tempora)

[[security-considerations]]
== Security Considerations

* Authentication information is stored in a file (SNMP community, CLI
username, CLI password), the data in the file could be encrypted for
security

[[quality-assurance-test-coverage-etc]]

* 16 APIs, 18 unit tests in total:
** FlowProgrammer: 3 APIs, 3 unit tests (all passed)
** ConfigService (extended APIs): 13 APIs, 13 unit tests (all passed)
** Switch discovery: 1 unit test (passed)
