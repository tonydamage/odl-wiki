|Name |Description |-align="left" valign="top" |Receive Machine |This
state machine receives LACPDUs from the Partner, records the information
contained, evaluates the incoming information from the Partner to
determine whether the Actor and Partner have both agreed upon the
protocol information exchanged to the extent that the port can now be
safely used, either in an aggregation with other ports or as an
individual port; if not, it asserts NTT in order to transmit fresh
protocol information to the Partner. |-align="left" valign="top"
|Periodic Transmission Machine |This state machine determines whether
the Actor and its Partner will exchange LACPDUs periodically in order to
maintain an aggregation (periodic LACPDU exchanges occur if either or
both are configured for Active LACP). |-align="left" valign="top"
|Selection Logic Machine |The Selection Logic is responsible for
selecting the Aggregator to be associated with this port. All the ports
within a system that have the same operational LACP Key are aggregated
as single aggregator, except for the ports are configured as
‘Individual’ (ports that are configured to be not aggregated).
|-align="left" valign="top" |MUX Machine |This component is responsible
for attaching the port to a selected Aggregator, detaching the port from
a de-selected Aggregator, and for turning on/off collecting and
distributing at the port as required by the current protocol
information. |-align="left" valign="top" |TX Engine |This component
transmits LACPDUs, both on demand from the other state machines, and on
a periodic basis. |-align="left" valign="top" |LACP Flow Utils |This
component provide service to transform Link Aggregation requests to SAL
flow service requests.

[[expected-dependencies-on-other-projects]]
== Expected Dependencies on Other Projects

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Depends On |Dependency Description |Needed By |Is in Other Project
Release Plan
|Topology Manager |The LACP module would negotiate with peer and decide
on LAG formation. LACP module should be able to add/delete/modify
logical ports to the Topology manager. The logical port details should
include information about the physical ports that it comprises of. |M2
|Already supported in Helium

|OpenFlow Plugin |The LACP module must be able to add/delete/modify the
group tables, buckets and action sets. |M2 |Already supported in Helium
|=======================================================================

[[expected-incompatibilities-with-other-projects]]
== Expected incompatibilities with other projects

LACP module will store the LAG information in DataStore. All interested
applications must register with MD-SAL for notifications about
additions, deletions and updates to the LAG information. Any project
that wants to make useof the LAG will have to make sure that their flows
point to the group table entries created by the LACP module.

[[themes-and-priorities]]
== Themes and Priorities

[[test-tool-requirements]]
== Test Tool Requirements

We will be using mininet to test the LACP passive mode functionality, in
the rackspace setup. The setup needs to support openvswitch 2.3.x
version in order to be able to program group tables.
