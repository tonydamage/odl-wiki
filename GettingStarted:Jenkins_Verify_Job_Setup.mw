== Introduction ==

The purpose of the Verify Job is to run on every Gerrit Patchset submitted and automatically carry out the 'Verify' step
so that the reviewer can be assured that the build continues to work and tests continue to pass and need only focus on 
reading the code.

== Caveats ==
'''Note:''' to complete these steps you will need to be a committer on the project for which you are doing it.

'''Note:''' in all examples given below, '''repo_name''' is used a stand in for the repo name of your project and
'''project_name''' is the name of your project. Please substitute appropriately.
