== Intent Overview

[[whats-intent]]
==== What's Intent

* Provide a high level description of requirements to network with the
abstraction from top down.
* It conceals complexity to the network implementation but eases the
application invocation.
* Use declarative expression for user intent, not how to do something.

[[intent-nbi-players]]
==== Intent NBI players

* The end user: do not have much network knowledge, want to use the
network in a simple way.
* Orchestration layer app developer：network is only part of the app
development, want to call simple APIs
* Administrator：ease the OAM, reduce the OPEX

[[intent-layers]]
==== Intent Layers

* A single intent layer for different actors
* A well designed intent NBI and models can fit for various actors with
grouping and customization, very much like different templates.

=== Network Intent

* Object
** EPG/Node: the data processing point in communication system, source,
destination or intermediate point. A node can include other nodes, which
is a group. Network/ Subnet/ Port/ FW/ LB in neutron is concrete type of
EPG/Node.
** Connection: relationship between two groups, it can respect resource
between two groups
** Flow: specific traffic in network, it can be identified by tuples in
packet header or high level properties e.g. DPI information, Dest/Src
nodes.
* Operation
** simple operation: CRUD operation directly to objects
** advanced operation:
*** Policy: with condition do action
*** Query: read operation with filters
*** Notification: an asynchronous way to get information from the
network
