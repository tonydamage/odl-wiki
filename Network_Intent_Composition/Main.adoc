This Network Intent Composition project will enable the controller to
manage and direct network services and network resources based on
describing the “Intent” for network behaviors and network policies.
Intents are described to the controller through a new NorthBound
Interface, which provides generalized and abstracted policy semantics
instead of Openflow-like flow rules. The Intent based NBI allows for a
descriptive way to get what is desired from the infrastructure, unlike
the current SDN interfaces which are based on describing how to provide
different services. This NBI will accommodate orchestration services and
network and business oriented SDN applications, including OpenStack
Neutron, Service Function Chaining, and Group Based Policy. The Network
Intent Composition function will use existing OpenDaylight Network
Service Functions and Southbound Plugins to control both virtual and
physical network devices. The Network Intent Composer will be designed
to be protocol agnostic such that any control protocol can be used such
as Openflow, OVSDB, I2RS, Netconf, SNMP etc.
