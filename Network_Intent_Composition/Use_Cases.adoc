_This page contains a short description and mock intents for use cases
we plan to support in the NIC project. This is a work-in-progress,
meaning that all use cases listed here may not yet be agreed upon._

[[service-chaining]]
== Service Chaining

The Interface between an SDN controller and a CMS for SFC must allow the
details of implementing the service chain to be decided within the
controller "black box" The intent interface does not include any details
of actual communication between devices and virtual functions. What is
passed to the SDN controller is a description of the relationships
between terminating systems and those that are inserted between them.
This interface describes the what (send through firewall type X), rather
than the how (connect this instance to this one).

The basic unit of the intent system is an end point group (EPG). This is
an abstraction that is used to describe how to treat traffic from
entities that need similar network behaviors. In the trivial case an EPG
might contain only a single End-Point (EP)> Furthermore, to use the
intent interface, you do not have to understand what an endpoint is. It
is also an abstraction that represents some kind of traffic source that
can be identified by looking at various bits in the traffic on the wire.

For SFC we start off by recognizing that a pool of virtual network
function with like behaviors maps perfectly to our primary intent
abstraction, the EPG. In the trivial case, I have a single firewall. I
add it to EPG as the only member and name that EPG the firewall group. I
create a LAN EPG to represent all my PCs, and an Internet EPG to
represent my cable router. Now I create a forward graph saying that all
traffic from my LAN to the internet should go through the firewall (LAN
EPG -> firewall EPG -> Internet EPG). As I add PCs to my LAN they get
the firewall treatment. When I buy a second firewall and add to the
network, I add it to the firewall EPG and the controller starts to load
balance across the two. Etc.

For the simplest version of this use case we propose a very simple
initial model:

EPG EP L2 or L3 Redirect Verb.

From these simple atoms we can support some simple SFC use cases. The
model shall include extensible end-point definitions and intent verbs,
contraints, etc.

|Service Chain
|The "verb" we choose to represent this
|======================================

To send traffic between say, the users group and the internet, via a
firewall and an IPS system, the operator would configure: EP,
"Firewall", L2Addr=xyzxyzxyzz EP, "IPS", L2Addr=012345678 EPG, "IPS",
\{IPS} EP, "Bob", L3Addr=a.b.c.d EP, "Jim", L3Addr=a.b.c.e EPG
"Firewall" \{Firewall"} EPG "Users" \{Bob, Jim} EP "Internet"
L3Addr=FF.FF.FF.FF EPG "Internet" \{Internet}

Now the group "policy"

USERS chain firewall chain IPS chain Interent

For another example, with L3/L4 identifiers, a user (could be an
application) wants a flow from source 172.255.255.1 port 10 to
destination 172.255.253.2 port 12 to go through a firewall and then a
parental control. The source endpoint is identified by 172.255.255.1
port 10. The destination endpoint is identified by 172.255.253.2 port
12. The Service Chain consists of "FW type + FW rules" and "Parental
Control type + Control rules". Favor is introduced to differentiate
different treatments provided by the same type of service function. For
example, a firewall could have different rules which can be categorized
by different flavors. Each type of service function has its own
definition of flavor.

[[network-monitoring-of-a-single-user]]
== Network Monitoring of a Single User

An application wants to monitor all traffic from a specific endpoint. A
copy of the traffic will be sent to a listener service which collects
the monitored traffic (ie: wire-tapping). The application wants to
specify the intent even if the endpoint is not currently connected to
the network, and have the intent applied once the endpoint connects. The
intent should apply even as the endpoint changes location.

[[dns-monitoring-for-infection]]
== DNS monitoring for infection

An application wants to inspect (hijack) all DNS packets to determine if
an endpoint is attempting to access a site which is known to be
malicious. If an endpoint attempts to resolve a malicious site, the
application wants to respond with a DNS failure. If an endpoint attempts
to resolve too many malicious sites, the application will presume that
the endpoint is infected and will block the endpoint from further
communication on the network.

[[suspicious-ddos-activity-monitoring]]
== Suspicious DDoS activity monitoring

An application wants to inspect all traffic through the internet
gateways to any destinations within the network. A copy of the traffic
will be sent to a listener service, which will perform deeper inspection
on the traffic. Alternately, traffic statistics could be gathered. If a
specific destination within the network looks suspicious either due to
deeper inspection or statistics, the application will express a second
intent which redirects traffic destined for that destination through a
DDoS service.

[[lync-call-qos]]
== Lync call QoS

An application wants to optimize MS Lync call quality. The application
gets notified by the Lync server when a new call is established. For
*each* new call, the application will provide an intent to set QoS
between the two endpoints involved in the call. The application will
also optimize traffic to/from the Lync server. The application will also
preserve existing QoS on any voice vlans:

[[openstack-integration-isolated-logical-networks]]
== OpenStack Integration: Isolated logical networks

OpenStack provides a way to create an isolated logical network, and
launch VM instances on the logical network. To establish isolated
communication between VM instances in the same logical network,
OpenStack requests *Intents with Allow operation* to the Intent system.

E.g.) When an OpenStack user creates two logical networks (Network A and
B), and launches three VM instances on each logical network, OpenStack
requests the following Intents.

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|SrcEPG |DstEPG |Operation
|*EPG A* (associated with Network A) |*EPG A* (associated with Network
A) |Allow

|*EPG B* (associated with Network B) |*EPG B* (associated with Network
B) |Allow
|=======================================================================

In this example, OpenStack registers two EPGs on the Intent system. For
each EPG, OpenStack puts three MAC address for three VM instances.

[[l2switch]]
== L2Switch

[[host-discovery]]
=== Host Discovery

An application within the controller wants to discover end-hosts on the
network. The application wants to listen to all ARP and DHCP packets to
learn the location of IPv4 end-hosts:

[[link-discovery]]
=== Link Discovery

An application within the controller wants to discover links between
controlled switches. The application wants to inject LLDP packets from
each connected switch port, then listen to any such packets received on
controlled switch ports:

[[end-point-policy-resolution]]
== End Point / Policy Resolution

An application should be able to specify an end point or all members of
an end point group as a query against a abstract identification scheme
such as "labels". Additionally, it may be possible for and EPG to
reference an existing resolution. For example if you want to connect a
host to a web server it is possible that in an given deployment there
are multiple (identical) web servers in each location, thus the web
server to which the host should connect depends on the location of the
host.

Finally, the policy specified for an intent may be abstract as well and
require resolution or precision to be defined, or could be a combination
of abstract and precise specification.

[[multilayer-adjacency]]
== Multilayer Adjacency

The point of this use case is to allow the specification of an adjacency
that will allow the path that implements the adjacency to traverse
multiple network layers, leveraging L2-0 forwarding when it best suites
the fulfillment needs of the request. How and when layer transforms and
forwards are used depends on the "sideways" injection of policy or
specific precision specified in the initial request. As has been
discussed in email threads intent composition or multiple intents being
rendered as a single atomic unit may be outside the scope of the initial
implementation, but it will be required for a complete implementation.
Customers have already requested patch computation with such constraints
such as "include node" or "exclude node".

[[diverse-intents]]
== Diverse Intents

The point of this use case is to be able to inform the system that the
realization of a set of intents should be diverse in that shared risk is
eliminated or minimized to an acceptable level.

LOW_LATENCY, PROTECTED, DIVERSE(INTENT-1234, INTENT-5678)
|=======================================================================

[[multi-point-vpn-intent]]
== Multi-point VPN Intent

The point of this use case is to establish private, secure
communications between multiple end points. The communication should be
bidirectional between all EPGs. It is unclear how to express this use
case given only a src and dst EPG, unless it breaks down into multiple
intents. As such I modified the format for the intent.

|==========================================================

[[bandwidth-on-demand]]
== Bandwidth on Demand

The point of this use case is adjusting the bandwidth on demand which is
triggered by specific "conditions".

*For example, there's a connection between the branch(located in
Beijing) and headquarter (located in Shanghai) offices*

* The bandwidth of the connection can be adjusted on demand.
* The adjustment can be triggered by "conditions", e.g.the bandwidth
will be adjusted at specific time.
* Bandwidth can be adjusted by application, eg. Video, email

[[enterprise-with-multiple-branches]]
== Enterprise with multiple branches

An enterprise has three big offices , separately located in Los Angeles,
Houston and New York. as shown in the following picture
image:Enterprise-branches.jpg [Enterprise with multiple
branches,title="fig:Enterprise with multiple branches"]

The requirement is to establish network communication for all offices
with guaranteed QoS. The security policy of the enterprise requires all
traffic sent to the New York Office must go through the firewall service
node before reaching the destination. User requires 10Gbps throughput
for the firewall.
