* Sharon mentioned that using YANG for TSDR data model would not have
significant impact on performance and volunteered to help with YANG file
creation on the data model definition.
* YuLing mentioned that since thereâ€™s no significant difference between
using YANG or hand coding TSDR data model in data storage case, we will
go with two steps: a) using hand coded TSDR data model to complete Data
Storage features, b) merge it with the YANG data model that Sharon is
providing.
* Sharon proposed using OpenTSDB directly in TSDR project for data
collection, data storage, and among others.
* YuLing described that TSDR project goal is beyond OpenTSDB in the
following perspectives: a) providing a common TSDR data model, b)
providing a common generic TSDR persistence layer to support multiple
data store plugins, c) native integration with ODL.

Moreover, at the end of M2, completely changing the solution would hit
the release delivery schedule.

* Basheer suggested a) Sharon to send out an email to entire TSDR team
to solicit feedback, b)Continue working on planned tasks to have
successful M2 delivery.
* Everyone agreed to resume M2 discussion on 02/03.
