The Model-Driven SAL (MD-SAL) is an infrastructure component that provides messaging and data storage functionality for based on user-defined (application developers) data and interface models.

MD-SAL has two main objectives:

* Provide a '''common-layer''', '''concepts''', '''data''' model '''building blocks''' and '''patterns''' which serves as building blocks  applications
* support of multiple transport and payload formats, serialization/adaptation them.

This objectives are achieved by using YANG as modeling language for interface
and data definition and providing runtime for services using YANG modeling.

Basic concepts are building blocks, from which MD-SAL derives its services,
behavior based on mapping of basic concepts to developer-supplied YANG models.

== Supported API, Transport, Payload variations ==

One of the target objective of MD-SAL is to expose functionality of providers
via various transport/payload formats, without any coding required on provider
side.

MD-SAL currently exposes following transport/payload formats (Hydrogen):

* [[OpenDaylight Controller:MD-SAL:Explained:Java YANG Binding|'''intra-JVM''' communication using '''generated DTOs''']] (Java YANG Binding)
* [[OpenDaylight Controller:MD-SAL:Explained:Java YANG DOM|'''intra-JVM''' communication using '''YANG DOM Model''']]
* '''HTTP''' consumer-only APIs using [[OpenDaylight Controller:MD-SAL:Explained:Restconf|'''Restconf''', '''XML''' and '''JSON''']] as payload

Experimental transport/payload formats (Hydrogen):

* '''Cross-process''' APIs using '''ZeroMQ''' and '''XML''' as payload

Planned transport/payload format (Helium):

* [[OpenDaylight Controller:MD-SAL:Architecture:Clustering|'''Cross-JVM''' communication using '''Akka''']]
