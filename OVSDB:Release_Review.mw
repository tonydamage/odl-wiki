==Project Name==
OVSDB Integration

==Features==
<big>'''OVSDB Major Features Include'''</big>

*Implements [RFC 7047] Open vSwitch (OVS) Database Protocol (OVSDB)
*Allows for the configuration of any Open vSwitch software schema implementation.
*OVSDB uses JSON [http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7047/ RFC4627] for the schema and wire protocol presentation.
*Supports up to the latest experimental OVS version 2.0.9 and is fullly backwards compatable with all older version including schema support.
*The OVSDB configuration manager residing in OpenDaylight can be used as a listener that waits for an OVS element to attach to it and then be configured once the JSON/RPC channel is negotiated.
*The OVSDB configuration manager can also be configured as an initiator to attach to OVS elements and remotely configure them in that direction.
*Create, modify, delete ports and all the various attributes of a port.
*Create, modify, delete encapsulated tunnels supporting CAPWAP, GRE and VXLAN framing.
*OVSDB can remotely setup the OpenFlow controller target and any details in handle the management plane functions supporting the control and data planes.
*OVSDB Library using Bidirectional JSON-RPC implementation
*OVSDB OpenVswitch plugin to support OpenVSwitch OVSDB Schema
*REST APIs for OVSDB Server Table Management (CRUD)
*Support for OpenStack Neutron ML2 Plugin using the OpenDaylight Mechanism Driver
*Integration with Openflow1.0 and Openflow1.3 plugins.
*Both per flow and per bridge tunnel keying
*API Support for all combinations of OVSDB transactions.
*Full support for the AD-SAL

==Architectural Issues==
* Due to the NODE-TYPE issues between MD-SAL & AD-SAL, OVSDB Neutron cannot use MD-SAL for Openflow1.0 (even with AD-SAL Adapters).
* Clustering service not available when using MD-SAL based NSF bundles like Forwarding Rules Manager.

==Security Considerations==

==Quality Assurance (test coverage, etc)==
* Functional test support for bridge, port, and tunnel creation

==End-of-life (API/Features EOLed in Release)==

==Schedule (initial schedule and changes over the release cycle)==
The project roughly followed its release plan but failed on the code-freeze deadline due to the OpenFlow1.3 integration issues.
But finally delivered on all of the set goals & features.
