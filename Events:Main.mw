=== HackFests ===
OpenDaylight HackFests are official events that are organized, sponsored, and run by OpenDaylight.  HackFests are key to the mission of OpenDaylight with the purpose of bringing the technical community together to write code, make decisions, onboard new and interested developers, and generally move the project forward.

=== Global Meet-ups ===
Global Meet-ups are outreach by and for the community, typically 1 to 3 hours long.
* A self-organized group with several primary speakers who will be presenting on a variety of user or developer topics
* Potentially have a "social hour" for impromptu conversations and expanding the base of people involved
* Subgroups can gather in a corner to work on specific code, a configuration, or other technical topic that they have in common
* OpenDaylight will fund $12.50/person* ($250 max per meet-up*) and provide a checklist to help with planning  (*''pre-approval needed'')
