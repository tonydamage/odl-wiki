=== OpenDaylight Summit, February 4-5, 2014 (Santa Clara, CA) ===
The OpenDaylight Summit is a new annual conference designed to provide a collaboration and education space for innovators, developers, and users in the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) space.  The OpenDaylight Summit brings together the community, projects, products, and companies in the networking industry that are driving the SDN and NFV ecosystems today, along with best practices from the world of traditional open source.

=== HackFests ===
OpenDaylight HackFests are official events that are organized, sponsored, and run by OpenDaylight.  HackFests are key to the mission of OpenDaylight with the purpose of bringing the technical community together to write code, make decisions, onboard new and interested developers, and generally move the project forward.

* Proposed mini-HackFest for MD-SAL developer and activity work areas: April 22-24 in San Jose or Slovakia Europe.
