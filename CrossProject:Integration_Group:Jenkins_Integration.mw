== Introduction ==
This instruction explains how to configure Jenkins in a community Lab to trigger and automate OpenDaylight tests. 

== Master Jenkins Installation ==
Jenkins can be installed in one of the following VMs:

* 1. Stand-alone VM

* 2. Same VM as Robot FW (recommended)

* 3. Same VM as Robot FW and device simulation (mininet, CBench)

* 4. Same VM as Robot FW, device simulation (mininet, CBench) and controller (not recommended)


Option 2 is recommended because controller and device simulation should run in their own VM

Option 4 is not recommended because both controller and Jenkins use default port 8080 for the GUI


Please follow this link to install Jenkins: https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Installing+Jenkins

Once you are done with the installation, you should be able to open the Jenkins GUI at http://127.0.0.1:8080

== Master Jenkins Configuration ==

=== 1. Setup Security ===

On the left menu click on '''Manage Jenkins''':

<br/> [[File:1-Jenkins-Manage.png|900px]] <br/><br/>

Press on '''Setup Security''' and configure as below:

<br/> [[File:2-Jenkins-Security.png|900px]] <br/><br/>

After saving changes you will be redirected to main page, from there select '''Sign-up''' on the top right corner and fill as below:

<br/> [[File:3-Jenkins-Signup.png|600px]] <br/><br/>

Now you are logged in as odluser.

=== 2. Install Plugins ===

Go to '''Manage Jenkins''' > '''Manage Plugins''' and select '''Available''' tab

<br/> [[File:4-Jenkins-Plugins.png|900px]] <br/><br/>

Search and select following packages:

* Conditional Buildstep Plugin
* EnvInjec Plugin
* Gerrit Trigger
* Git Client Plugin
* GIT Plugin
* Parameterized Trigger plugin
* Robot Framework plugin
* XTrigger Plug-in

Then press on '''Install without restart'''

Select Restart Jenkins when installation is complete at the bottom:

== Slave Jenkins Install ==

Slave Jenkins will be installed on the other VMs that are part of the test bed. In this example the controller VM.

=== 1. Setup SSH access Master to Slave ===

Generate SSH key pair for user jenkins in the Jenkins Master:

<pre>
~\> sudo su - jenkins
~\> ssh-keygen 
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Created directory '/var/lib/jenkins/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
1d:b8:ef:a4:c5:fe:65:d0:29:c6:ed:c9:21:c0:a5:fe jenkins@odl-test-desktop
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 2048]----+
|            .    |
|         o o     |
|        . =      |
|         + + o . |
|        S o * =  |
|         o o * o |
|          = E *  |
|         *   o   |
|        . o..    |
+-----------------+
</pre>

Move the Master public key to the Slave (controller VM):

<pre>
~\> ssh-copy-id jenkins@10.1.19.33
The authenticity of host '10.1.19.33 (10.1.19.33)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is 0d:2b:a6:07:81:9a:d2:ce:42:d7:75:d8:19:c1:fb:b4.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added '10.1.19.33' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
jenkins@10.1.19.33's password: 
Now try logging into the machine, with "ssh 'jenkins@10.1.19.33'", and check in:

  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

</pre>

Note that controller VM has already a user called jenkins but it could be any name.

Finally check the SSH key is properly installed by connecting to controller and verifying no password is being asked:

<pre>
~\> ssh jenkins@10.1.19.33
Welcome to Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.11.0-15-generic x86_64)
</pre>

=== 2. Setup  Master Jenkins credentials ===

Configure Master Jenkins credentials. From Jenkins main menu go to '''Credentials''' > '''Global credentials''' and select '''Add some credential''':

=== 3. Configure Slave Jenkins ===

Second go to '''mange Jenkins''' > '''Manage Nodes''' and press on '''New Node''' from left menu:
