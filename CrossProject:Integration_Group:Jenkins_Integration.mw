== Introduction ==
This instruction explains how to configure Jenkins in a community Lab to trigger and automate OpenDaylight tests. 

== Jenkins Installation ==
Jenkins can be installed in one of the following VMs:

* 1. Stand-alone VM

* 2. Same VM as Robot FW (recommended)

* 3. Same VM as Robot FW and device simulation (mininet, CBench)

* 4. Same VM as Robot FW, device simulation (mininet, CBench) and controller (not recommended)


Option 2 is recommended because controller and device simulation should run in their own VM

Option 4 is not recommended because both controller and Jenkins use default port 8080 for the GUI


Please follow this link to install Jenkins: https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Installing+Jenkins

Once you are done with the installation, you should be able to open the Jenkins GUI at http://127.0.0.1:8080
