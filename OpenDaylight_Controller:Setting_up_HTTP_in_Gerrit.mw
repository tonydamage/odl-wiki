If your corporate firewall blocks Gerrit's standard ssh port (29418), you can setup Gerrit so you can use https instead.

Log into Gerrit at https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/
This link works best in Firefox or Chrome. 

Due to the current locked down state, you must log in to Gerrit to get any useful information, and you can only get the code after you have registered an ssh key.

When you log in you will see a very boring screen (shown below) and need to click '''SignIn'''

Which will prompt you to sign in.  Please use the same credentials you have to log in for other OpenDaylight purposes.  If you need additional purposes to have accounts, please email [mailto:helpdesk@opendaylight.org helpdesk@opendaylight.org]
You can see below the login prompt:

Once signed in you will be able to see existing Gerrit requests, patches that folks have pushed that have not yet been verified, reviewed, and merged into the authoritative repo.  HTTP Password.

First, click Settings:

Then select 'HTTP Password'

And finally click 'Generate Password'

You can then use that generated password for https using the git command 

<pre>
git clone https://<your_username>@git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/p/controller.git
</pre>
