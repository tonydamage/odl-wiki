The OpFlex renderer is based on the [[Group_Policy:Architecture/OVS Overlay|OVS Overlay]] design and implements a network virtualization solution for virtualized compute environments by communicating with the OpFlex Agent.

== Renderer Architecture ==
XXX - TODO Main pieces:
* Agent Manager: Manage connected agents using OpFlex.
* RPC Library: Manage serialization/deserialization of JSON RPC with Policy Elements
* Endpoint manager: Optionally learn endpoints based on simple rules that map interfaces to endpoint groups. Can add additional rules in the future. Keep endpoint registry up to date. If disabled, then an orchestration system must program all endpoints and endpoint mappings.
* Policy manager: subscribe to renderer common infrastructure and endpoint registry and provide normalized policy to agents
== Configuration ==
XXX - TODO
* Mapping of interfaces to endpoint groups
* Mapping of endpoint groups to vnids/classes
