= Defense4All REST APIs Overview

Defense4All supports REST APIs with json encoding. All framework REST
resources appear under “/rest/general/”, while all Defense4All
application resources appear under “/rest/app/df/”.

*Remarks* –

1.  Defining PNs with overlapping destination addresses should be
avoided (may lead to unpredictable results).
2.  Configuration properties - Because Defense4All is a pluggable
application and framework, its general REST API must not include any
component specific configurations as named parameters in PN. To allow
configuration of pluggable components the notion of configuration
properties is used. Any configuration setup, specific to a pluggable
component should be configured as a property carrying a unique property
name. *amsConfigProps* properties are optional AMS configuration
properties, specific per each AMS. Read AMS specific documentation to
see what properties should be set. The reference AMS implementation over
Radware DefensePro uses default configuration and therefore does not
require configuration properties. *Props* are optional configuration
properties of all other pluggable components (like additional future
pluggable attack detectors, mitigation drivers, or versions of ODC).
3.  Specified NetNodes - NetNodes through which PN traffic normally
flows (if not redirected), NetNodes to which AMSs relevant to this PN
attack mitigation are connected, or both. Defense4All places traffic
counters on NetNodes with traffic ports. It diverts attacked PN traffic
to one/some of the AMSs connected to NetNodes in this set.
4.  Bytes and packets values represent combined values of the respective
protocol-port-direction from all counter locations, from which
statistics for this PN are taken.
5.  A trafficData contains bytes and packets rate values per some
combination of protocol-port-direction). *forTrafficLearning* associated
with each trafficData indicates whether that trafficData should be
accounted for traffic learning – calculating averages.
*forTrafficLearning* is set to false for attacked trafficData, otherwise
it is normally true. This indicator is only relevant to *latestRateStr*.

Defense4All general REST API must not include any component specific
configurations as named parameters in AMS. To allow configuration of
pluggable components the notion of configuration properties is used. Any
AMS specific configuration setup should be configured as a property
carrying a unique property name. *Props* are the optional configuration
properties of the AMS.
2.  An AMS may be connected to a NetNode via multiple input-output port
pairs. The can be done for enhanced availability or traffic isolation.
However the AMS label for each connection must be unique. Logically,
therefore, each AMS port-pair map to a separate AMS with its unique
label.

*Remarks* –

1.  Configuration properties - Because NetNode is a pluggable component
in nature, the Defense4All general REST API must not include any
component specific configurations as named parameters in NetNode. To
allow configuration of pluggable components the notion of configuration
properties is used. Any NetNode specific configuration setup should be
configured as a property carrying a unique property name. *Props* are
the optional configuration properties of the AMS.
2.  NetNode id field can mean different things in different kinds of
NetNodes. In SDN switches/routers this is the DPID. In virtual
environments, like VTN this is the VTN id. In other abstracted domains
of network control sphere this may be the id of the domain.
3.  SdnNodeMode and ProtectedLinks - ODL Reps supports two types of SDN
Switches: sdn-hybrid, which support both SDN and legacy routing, and
sdn-native, which supports SDN only routing. Counting traffic in
sdn-hybrid switch can be simply accomplished by programming a flow entry
with desired traffic selection criteria and the action is “send to
normal”, i.e., continue with legacy routing. Counting traffic in
sdn-native switch requires an explicit routing action (i.e., which
output port to send the traffic to). Defense4All avoids learning all
routing tables by requiring an sdn-native switch which is more or less a
bump-in the wire with respect to traffic routing, If a NetNode is
configured with switch entry-exit port pairs, say 1-2 and 3-4, then
traffic entering port 1 normally exits port 2 and traffic entering port
3 normally exits port 4 and vice versa. Such a switch allows for easy
programming of flow entries just to count traffic or to divert traffic
to/from attached AMS. So when Defense4All programs a traffic counting
flow entry with selection criteria that includes port 1, its action will
be output to port 2, and similarly with 3 to 4.
4.  Since version 1.1 - An AMS may be connected to a NetNode via
multiple input-output port pairs. The can be done for enhanced
availability or traffic isolation. label of each AMS connection must be
unique.

*Remarks* –

1.  Retrieving monitored traffic records is to be supported in future
releases.
2.  See trouble-shooting of mitigation status NO_RESOURCES.
3.  Depending on the point of attacked traffic redirection, ODC based
stats collection at that point may or may not be relevant. In this
release, it is always true.
4.  Mitigation execution properties are optional properties specific for
different mitigation devices and methods.
5.  Mitigation traffic floor - The set of flow entries programmed to
divert (but still count) traffic. There may be many attack traffic
floors, all of which take precedence over the peacetime stats collection
floor (by programming higher priority flow entries). Additional attacks
(except “other ip” attack which is special case, and is suppressed here)
are created with higher priority traffic floors over previously set
attack traffic floors. Attacks may fully or partially “eclipse” earlier
attacks (e.g., tcp port 80 over tcp or vice versa) or be disjoint (e.g.,
tcp and udp). Stats collection is taken from all traffic floors –
peacetime and attacks. At the end of mitigation all its traffic floors
are simply removed.
6.  Diversion Info is to be retrievable in future releases.
