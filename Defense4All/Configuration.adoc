For details of invoking the configuration steps listed below, refer to
the WEB UI, REST, or CLI sections. Configuration steps should be
performed in the order specified (in the future configuration order
restrictions will be lifted):

1.  Set Defense4All control network address
2.  Add the ODC (single) controller.
3.  (Optional) add AMSs attached to SDN Switches/Routers controlled by
the ODC.
4.  Add the SDN Switches/Routers controlled by the ODC.
5.  Add the Protected Objects.

In this release change in an element (ODC, AMS, NetNode, PN) requires
removing all the elements in the subsequent steps, removing the element
to be changed, adding the changed element value and finally re-adding
all the subsequent elements. Removal of an element removes both its
configuration as well as any dynamically obtained data.

Defense4All allows the user to perform factory reset - removing the all
configuration as well as dynamically obtained data. More granular types
of reset are to be supported in the future.
