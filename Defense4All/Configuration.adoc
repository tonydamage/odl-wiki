Please refer to the REST or the CLI sections for details of invoking the
configuration steps listed below. Configuration steps should be
performed in the order specified below (in the future configuration
order restrictions will be lifted):

1.  Set Defense4All host address
2.  Add the ODC (single) controller - using the addOFC API/CLI.
3.  (Optional) add AMSs attached to SDN Switches/Routers controlled by
the ODC. The included reference implementation is for Radware DefensePro
devices.
4.  Add the SDN Switches/Routers controlled by the ODC – using the
addNetNode API/CLI.
5.  Add the PNs of choice – using the addPN.

In this release change in an element (ODC, AMS, NetNode, PN) requires
removing all the elements in the subsequent steps, then removing the
element to be changed, then adding the changed element value, and
finally re-adding all the subsequent elements. Removal of an element
removes both its configuration as well as any dynamically obtained data.

Defense4All allows the user to perform factory reset (the reset API/CLI)
- removing the all configuration as well as dynamically obtained data.
More granular types of reset are to be supported in the future.
