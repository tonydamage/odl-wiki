[[introduction]]
== Introduction

No new features planned for Lithium hence no release deliverables beyond
integration and testing of latest (Helium) Defense4All into the Lithium
release.

[[externally-consumable-apis]]
== Externally Consumable APIs

* Please list and describe all externally consumable APIs or point to a
document that does so.

Defense4All:REST[Defense4All APIs]

* This need not be a list of all java interfaces and yang files, but
should be a list of high-level functionality, e.g., flow programming.
** For each such API, there should be a list of the bundles providing
the API, but not necessarily the implementation.
* Each PROVISIONAL or TENTATIVE API must be listed as project
deliverable
** Must be declared as "IN" or "OUT" at the M3 Milestone

[[expected-incompatibilities-with-other-projects]]
== Expected Incompatibilities with Other Projects

Please note any known or expected incompatibilities with other projects.
For example, the different projects providing Neutron APIs have
historically been incompatible with each other. For each
incompatibility:

1.  Note which expected features are incompatible if known
1.  Why
2.  Whether discussions occurred with the projects of the incompatible
features as to how to become compatible.
1.  The results of those discussion.

If the incompatibility is expected, but the features are not yet know,
please provide as much as is known or expected.

Projects are encouraged to engage with other projects to discuss and
explore ways this incompatibility can be avoided either during this
release or in a future release.

[[compatibility-with-previous-releases]]
== Compatibility with Previous Releases

[[removed-apis-andor-functionality]]
=== Removed APIs and/or Functionality

*TBD by M3*

* Please include list of a APIs and/or functionality that existed the
previous release and will be removed.
** For each such API/functionality, discuss any suggestions for how
those who are using it should adapt.
** In order for an API/functionality to be removed, it must have been
deprecated in a previous release.
*** Functionality and/or APIs that were correctly tagged with the
`@Deprecated` annotation in Java before the Helium release can be
considered deprecated and thus removed in Lithium.

[[deprecated-apis-andor-functionality]]
=== Deprecated APIs and/or Functionality

*TBD by M3*

* Please include list of a APIs and/or functionality that existed the
previous release and will be deprecated.
** For each such API/functionality, discuss any suggestions for how
those who are using it should adapt.
** If possible, e.g., for all human-generated Java, add the
`@Deprecated` annotation
** If not possible, please note clearly things which are deprecated in a
clearly visible manner

[[changed-apis-andor-functionality]]
=== Changed APIs and/or Functionality

*TBD by M3*

* Please include list of a APIs and/or functionality that existed the
previous release and will be changed.
** For each such API/functionality, provide guidance about who will be
affected and how they should adapt.
** In general, project's should strive to be backward compatible with
the previous release and note what functionality will be removed by
deprecating it and noting that with the `@Deprecated` annotations
wherever possible.

[[themes-and-priorities]]
== Themes and Priorities

[[requests-from-other-projects]]
== Requests from Other Projects

For each API request, the requesting project should create an entry like
the example below. After creating the entry, the requesting project
should send an e-mail to release@lists.opendaylight.org, and both
projects' dev lists using this template:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [REQUEST FOR NEW OR EXTENDED API] ${API name}

Note: This email is a request from ${requesting project} for a new or
extended API in ${providing project}.

API Name: ${API name}
Request: ${link to the request in the providing project's release plan}

Please let us know if you will be able to provide this new
functionality by the listed milestone. If you need clarifications or
help in providing the API, let us know so we can reach an agreement.

If you feel that providing this API is a bad idea regardless of where
the resources are coming from, please let us know why and ideally,
suggest and alternative.

[[test-tools-requirements]]
== Test Tools Requirements

* Please specify if the project will run System Test (ST) inside
OpenDaylight cloud
* In case affirmative please enumerate any test tool (mininet, etc...)
you think will be required for testing your project
** The goal is to start test tools installation in rackspace as soon as
possible
* In case negative be aware you will be required to provide System Test
(ST) reports upon any release creation (weekly Release, Release
Candidate, Formal Release, etc...)
