|Name |Description
|D4A-GUI |The Defense4All Graphical User Interface

|D4A-MIT |The Defense4All generic mitigation driver that will enable
using Defense4All even without a dedicated mitigation device by
supporting redirection of suspicious traffic to any port in the
controlled network. Packets will be redirected unchanged, hence the
device connected to the "redirection target port" is responsible for any
further processing of packets, including reinsertion into the network.

|D4A-TOP |Future deliverable: Extend the Defense4All functionality
beyond a single switch (as in Hydrogen) to general topologies
supported/controlled by a single controller. This deliverable depends on
the availability and capabilities of a network abstraction such as Group
Based Policy/Affinity/Service Chaining Service. UPDTATE: D4A-TOP will
not be included in Helium
