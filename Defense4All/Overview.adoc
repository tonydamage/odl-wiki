Defense4All is an SDN application for detecting and mitigating DDoS
attacks. The application communicates with OpenDaylight Controller via
the ODC north-bound REST API to perform two main tasks:

1.  Monitoring behavior of protected traffic - the application sets flow
entries in selected network locations to read and aggregate traffic
statistics for each of the Protected Networks (PNs).
2.  Diverting attacked traffic to selected Attack Mitigation Systems
(AMSs) – the application sets flow entries in selected network locations
to divert traffic to selected AMSs. When an attack is over the
application removes these flow entries, thus returning to normal
operation and traffic monitoring.

Defense4All can optionally configure, monitor, or collect and act upon
attack statistics from the defined AMSs. Defense4All contains a
reference implementation pluggable driver to communicate with Radware’s
DefensePro AMS. The application presents its north-bound management REST
and CLI APIs.
