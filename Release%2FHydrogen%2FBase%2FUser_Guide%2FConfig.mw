This page contains installation and configuration for the base edition. Click [[Release/Hydrogen/Base/User Guide|here]] to return to the main Base Edition User Guide page. 

==Installation==
The installation instructions for the Base Edition can be found [https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Release/Hydrogen/Base/Installation_Guide here].

A list of troubleshooting steps for installation can be found [https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Controller:Installation here] under the '''Troubleshooting''' section.

==Configuration==
To configure OpenDaylight Base edition using the OpenFlow 1.3 plugin, start Opendaylight Controller with the ''-of13'' option. If you do not use the option, the controller will use the OpenFlow 1.0 version. 

* To start mininet for the OpenFlow 1.3 simulation, use the following command: ''$ sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=a.b.c.d --topo tree,2 --switch ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow13'' 

* To start mininet for the OpenFlow 1.0 simulation, use the following command:  ''$ sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=10.125.136.52 --topo tree,2''

===Setup Using the Graphical Interface===

Log in using your credentials. The default credentials are user=admin/password=admin. The first page appears.

Under the Devices tab, all of the created nodes are listed with their Node ID and Ports. For example, if you set up Mininet to emulate a network topology by running ''sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=a.b.c.d --topo tree,2'', you create a network of tree structure with 3 switches. Those switches will be shown under the Devices menu as well as on the graphical interface, as shown below:

<br>
You can add a gateway by clicking on the button "Add Gateway IP Address" on the buttom-middle of the page:

<br>
You can also add flow entries by clicking on the button "Add Flow Entry" on the top-left of the page:
<br>

<br>
The minimum requirements to install a flow in a node are to identify the node (switch) and action for the flow entry. You can find other parameters for the flow at [http://openvswitch.org/cgi-bin/ovsman.cgi?page=utilities%2Fovs-ofctl.8 here] under the Flow Syntax.

<br>
You can access the Admin menu from top-right of the page by clicking on the '''admin''' selection. The available options are:
* '''Users''' to manage the users and their role
* '''Cluster''' for the cluster manager for high availability
* '''OSGi''' to access the OSGi management console
* '''Save''' to save the current setup
* '''Logout''' to exit from the GUI

===Command Line Interface===
The complete descriptions of OpenDaylight command line interfaces can be found [https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Command-Line_Interface_(CLI):Main#Switch_Commands here].

===Console Interface===
This information will be available soon. 

===Programmatic Interfaces===
For programmatic interfaces, the starting point for developers is [https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/GettingStarted:Developer_Main here]. This page provides information about pulling, hacking, and pushing the code from CLI. The OpenDaylight Controller allows developers to observe and manage the controller via web applications. A programmer guide can be found [https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Controller:Programmer_Guide here].
