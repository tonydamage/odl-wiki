== Intro ==

THIS PAGE HAS NO FORMAL STANDING!

It is just a landing spot for folks to put their Helium Release Vehicle proposals as subpages.
The *actual* Release Vehicles will be decided by the TSC, but the community needs to give them a helping hand by 
collecting proposals.

== Suggested Ground Rules ==

It is very helpful when putting together a Release Vehicle Proposal that we consider how to get all [[Simultaneous_Release:Helium_Release_Plan#Participating_Projects|Helium Participating Projects]] into at least one Release Vehicle that they feel happy about being in.  If you can't do this, your input is still helpful, but please mark your proposed Release Vehicle Plan as (INCOMPLETE) so we know its not a complete plan, and maybe we can take ideas from some of the INCOMPLETE plans to get a complete one :)

(feel free to suggest other helpful suggested ground rules here).

== Proposed Helium Release Vehicle Plans ==

* [[CrossProject:Helium Release Vehicle Brainstorming:Pure Karaf| Pure Karaf]]
* [[Simultaneous_Release:Helium_Release_Plan#Proposed_Release_Vehicles| Initial "stake in the ground" proposals]]
