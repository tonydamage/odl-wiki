The Internet of Things Data Management (IoTDM) on OpenDaylight (ODL)
project is about developing a data-centric middleware that will act as a
oneM2M compliant IoT Data Broker and enable authorized applications to
retrieve IoT data uploaded by any device. The ODL platform is used to
implement the oneM2M data store which models a hierarchical containment
tree, where each node in the tree represents an oneM2M resource.
Typically, IOT devices and applications interact with the resource tree
over standard protocols such as CoAP, MQTT, and HTTP.

Initially, the oneM2M resource tree is used by applications to retrieve
data. Possible applications are inventory/device management systems or
big data analytic systems designed to make sense of the data collected.
But, at some point, applications will need to configure the devices.
Features and tools will have to be provided to enable configuration of
the devices based on applications responding to user input, network
conditions, or some set of programmable rules or policies possibly
triggered by the receipt of data collected from the devices.

The ODL platform(s), with their rich unique cross-section of SDN
capabilities, NFV, and now IOT device and application management, can be
bundled with a targeted set of features and deployed anywhere in the
network to give the network/service provider ultimate control. Depending
on the use case, the ODL IOT platform can be configured with only IOT
data collection capabilities where it is deployed near the IOT devices
and its footprint needs to be small, or it can be configured to run as a
highly scaled up and out distributed cluster with IOT, SDN and NFV
functions enabled and deployed in a high traffic data center.

[[functional-architecture]]
== Functional Architecture

* Need a reference to TR0001 Use Cases
* Need a pretty picture on the network and where ODL fits
* oneM2M Resource Types and example of how they are used
* Notifications / Subscriptions

[[software-architecture]]
== Software Architecture

The ODL platform was chosen to implement the oneM2M data manager for its
rich feature set:

* MDSAL and transactional data store is a natural fit for the oneM2M
resource containment tree
* Flexible support for protocol plugin’s
* Clustering support for scale and performance
* Flexible distribution/deployment capabilities via OSGI and karaf
* Potential to leverage AAA and Group Based Policy features
* SDN and NFV feature interaction

[[component-descriptions]]
=== Component Descriptions

* onem2m-karaf: this is the folder which contains a local distribution
of karaf which contains the onem2m karaf features defined in the
features.xml file in the iotdm-features directory
* onem2m-features: contains the features.xml file which define the
onem2m feature set, repos, dependencies, and config files.
* onem2m-api: the definition of the oneM2M resources are defined in the
onem2m-api yang files. In addition, the RPCs to manage the resource tree
are defined here.
* onem2m-core: the provider of the oneM2M resource containment tree. The
onem2m-core provides/implements the MDSAL RPCs defined in the onem2m-api
yang files. These RPCs enable oneM2M resources to be created, read,
updated, and deleted (CRUD), and also enables the management of
subscriptions. When resources are CRUDed, the onem2m-notifier issues
oneM2M notification events to interested subscribers. TS0001: oneM2M
Functional Architecture and TS0004:oneM2M Service Layer Protocol are
great reference documents to learn details of oneM2M resource types,
message flow, formats, and CRUD/N semantics.
* onem2m-notifier: the manager of the oneM2M notification subsystem. The
onem2m-core implements the MDSAL RPCs defined to CRUD subscription
resources. These are _special_ resources that enable subscribers to be
notified if _normal_ oneM2M resources are CRUDed. This is the
publish-subscriber mechanism defined by oneM2M.
* link:IoTDM Protocols[ onem2m-protocols]: the root directory for the
oneM2M wire protocols. oneM2M defines request/response/error message
formats for each of the CRUD operations and resource types. It also
specifies how each of the oneM2M attributes are mapped/adapted to run
over a specific wire-protocol message fields. TS0004:oneM2M Service
Layer Protocol describes generally oneM2M messaging. The message formats
can be sent with a JSON payload, or an XML payload. OneM2M defines the
oneM2M.json and .xsd formats for each resource. The software has to
handle eventually both formats.
** coap: The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), is documented in
RFC7252; https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7252. The way oneM2M
defines how it should be used is described in TS0008: CoAP Protocol
Binding. This wire-protocol uses the Eclipse Technology Project:
Californium which implements the CoAP protocol. See
http://eclipse.org/proposals/technology.californium for details on the
implementation. onem2m-protocols/coap instantiates a Californium
CoapServer, and implements each of the :handleGet(), handleDelete(),
handleUpdate(), and handleCreate() methods. These methods adapt the coap
formatted messages into internal oneM2M messages as defined in the
iotdm-api yang files, then sends RPCs over MDSAL to the onem2m-core for
further processing.
** mqtt: This will be documented further once we start to look at it. It
is not at present in the Lithium release. TS0010: MQTT Protocol Binding.
** http: TS0009: HTTP Protocol Binding documents how to map oneM2M
messages onto the HTTP protocol.
** 3rd-party: There are two types of third party protocols, 1) oneM2M
messages are encoded and sent over the 3rd party protocol, and 2) a
non-oneM2M set of messages is defined by the endpoint and the third
party protocol plugin is responsible for mapping the mesages onto oneM2M
messages when they are received and invoking the internal onem2m-core
RPCs. More details on how this is done needs to be documented. A
reference to this will be placed HERE when completed.

[[iotdm-core-details]]
=== iotdm-core Details

Do we want one of these sections for further details. We could add one
for each of the components mentioned above. Maybe elaborate on some
issues, message flow, maybe a snippet of code, and/or pseudocode

[[design-considerations]]
==== Design Considerations

* concurrency
* message ordering issues
* lazy delete of "expired" resources discussion vs implementing a timer
wheel for resource expiration
* hierarchical vs non-hierarchical resourceId's
* unique resource id generation for created resources
* ???

[[threading-model]]
==== Threading Model

[[typical-onem2m-message-crud-rpc-flow]]
==== Typical OneM2M Message CRUD RPC Flow

* Describe the set of step that is typically done when a oneM2M
formatted RPC is received via MDSAL. It could be from RESTconf or one of
the iotdm-protocols (Coap, ...).
** Validate the message attributes
** Sanity check the mandatory attributes
** Write to the persistent datastore
** Send an event to the iotdm-notifier
** send back an RPC response

[[testing]]
== Testing

We need to talk about our overall test strategy ...

* Have a set of test scripts that drive oneM2M CRUD testing. Need a
whole suite of tests that performs CRUD operations, and verify they
worked.
** Example 1: create a resource, get the resource, verify all attributes
can be read, update the attributes, read and verify them back, delete
the resource, verify it is gone.
** Example 2: create 1000 resources, read resource 1, resource 1000, and
a couple in the middle. Verify all are read back properly.
** Example 3: IoTDM allows for a resource containment hierarchy ...,
create a simple hierarchy, read and verify resources at each level in
the tree. Then try again with a set of complex hierarchies. We are
automating this so use the computer to generate many different
combinations of hierarchies.
* Unit Testing
** Use unit tests to do CRUDs
** Every RPC method, or java method we write can be unit tested. We can
provided test steering parameters to drive the code through error cases
too! Need to take a look at how ODL [J]Unit tests code and setup an
environment so designers are encouraged and write unit tests.
** Each protocol can be individually tested at key points in the
implementation. Each of the protocols encodes the oneM2M attributes
according to its respective TSXXXX spec, drive in some parametrs and
ensure they are extracted as proper OneM2M messages. Test all response
codes.
* Feature Testing in iotdm-it
** This hasn't been fleshed out yet but we can get the system do perform
tests after every build and the ODL Jenkin's build system will run the
tests and report on PASS/FAIL and on Code Coverage
* External Testing
** Perform testing on the ODL IOTDM instance in various deployments with
various sets of karaf-features installed and with various cpu
configurations.
** Perform testing of all protocols, with single and multiple clients.
Scale up to MANY clients ...
*** Notification testing
*** Performance testing
**** Beat the crap out of it, find out how it behaves with various RAM
and CPU configs.
**** Use a testtool to send in concurrent connections so ODL thinks it
is handling different clients.
*** Scale testing
**** Ok, now really beat the crap out of it.
**** Load the system with MANY resources to see how it behaves over
time. Does the performance degrade with a huge deep resource tree vs a
broad shallow resource tree.
*** Longevity testing
**** Run it for a long time and observe its behaviour. Check for memory
leaks or performance degradation.
*** wire-protocol testing ... Coap, MQTT, HTTTP, and any 3rd Party
prtocols should be tested
**** Maybe we write a generic oneM2MClient package where we can vary the
wire-protocol
**** well formed messages
**** mal-formed messages
