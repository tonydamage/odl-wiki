The framework for Continuous System Integration Test will be hosted in existing OpenDaylight servers. In addition Ericsson offers a test environment in America. In order to help more people (especially in the East) to get familiar with ODP controller, Huawei established a new test lab in China. Both labs can be used for:
* Get familiar with controller (DUT)
* Evaluate test tools
* Debug system test code
This page will introduce how to use Huawei’s lab. The following is current Lab topology:

== Details Of VMs ==
Following VMs are already available:
* Test Tools image

== Book The Lab ==

To use the lab, you just need send request to administrator (odp-lab@huawei.com). Before you send the email, please see a free time slot at [http://demo-odplab.huawei.com/ here].

== Lab Access ==

Lab access is provided through SSH server with username/password. Every time you book the lab, you will receive an email from odp-lab@huawei.com which writes username/password pairs. In case of authentication problems, just feel free to contact odp-lab@huawei.com. Please follow the steps bellow to access the lab.
There are 2 approaches to access the SSH server. Please use the traffic subnet for test traffic and O&M subnet for operation traffic.

=== Access lab through SSH Client (recommended) ===

Execute command in prompt:
<pre>
ssh username@demo-odplab.huawei.com
</pre>
Then, use following commands to access VMs (172.16.54.11-14) and use ‘odluser1’ as password:
<pre>
~$ssh odlsuer@172.16.54.11
~$ssh odluser@172.16.54.12
~$ssh odluser@172.16.54.13
~$ssh odluser@172.16.54.14
</pre>
For SSH forwarding (SSH tunnels), execute (e.g. forwarding VNC traffic):
<pre>
ssh –L 15900:172.16.54.11:5900 username@demo-odplab.huawei.com
</pre>
Then just VNC to localhost:15900 to access 172.16.54.11’s desktop.

=== Access lab through web gate ===
For users who cannot work with port 22 (maybe behind a proxy or firewall), SSH web gate is provided through http protocol. To access SSH server through https, please visit URL at [https://demo-odplab.huawei.com/gateone https://demo-odplab.huawei.com/gateone]. After start controller at <Controller VM>, visit http://demo-odplab.huawei.com:8080 for OpenDaylight web GUI.
