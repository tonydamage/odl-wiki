* Repository of Archetypes for various use-cases which may include app
development, infrastructure component development, southbound plugin
development, Custom distribution, user interface, northbound APIs, apps
using northbound REST APIs, etc.
* Provide the Archetypes catalog for OpenDaylight
* In addition to the code and related resources, these Archetype
templates can also include necessary development toolkits such as
eclipse launchers, debug helpers, etc.
