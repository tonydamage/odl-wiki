== Intro == 

The next vHackFest is focused on Continuous Integration Testing.  All Projects participating in the Hydrogen Simultaneous Release have
committed to getting Continuous Integration Testing going no later than next week.  This vHackFest will bring all of us together to do so.

== When ==

Since OpenDaylight has participants all over the globe, the vHackFest will take place over a 24 hours period, beginning 
Thursday Sept 19, 2013 at 1am PST (10am CEST) and running till Friday Sept 20 at 1am PST (10am CEST).

Participants are not expected to stay up 24 hours, but rather to participate in their own normal work hours.

== Where ==

Coordination over all will happen one the #opendaylight IRC channel on Freenode.

In order to facilitate collaboration that may require screen sharing or voice, there are five Webexes available for folks to use for collaboration.
Since a Webex cannot last longer than 12 hours, there is a '1st Half' and '2nd Half' for each one:

'''Please update the "Current Topic" column as you grab a Webex for use, or finish using it so folks can see what's going on in each one.'''

== What ==

As this vHackFest is themed around Continuous Integration Testing, that will be the primary focus (though folks are also welcome to collaborate on other things as well).

=== How to ===
The key things we need to accomplish for the Continuous Integration Testing vHackFest are, for each project participating in the Hydrogen Release:

# Setup a Jenkins Integration Job for your project for each project you depend on
## See [[GettingStarted:Jenkins Integration Job Setup|Jenkins Integration Job Setup]]
# Write one or more Integration Tests for each project you depend on
## See [[OpenDaylight Controller:Integration Tests|Instructions on Writing Integration Tests]] and [[OpenDaylight Controller:Northbound Integration Tests|Instructions on Writing Northbound Integration Tests]] (many thanks to Kalvin Hom for the excellent documentation on these).

== Who ==

For each project in the Hydrogen Release, at least one person should sign up to Participate in the vHackFest
