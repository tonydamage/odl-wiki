== Intro == 

The next vHackFest is focused on Continuous Integration Testing.  All Projects participating in the Hydrogen Simultaneous Release have
committed to getting Continuous Integration Testing going no later than next week.  This vHackFest will bring all of us together to do so.

== When ==

Since OpenDaylight has participants all over the globe, the vHackFest will take place over a 24 hours period, beginning 
Thursday Sept 19, 2013 at 1am PST (10am CEST) and running till Friday Sept 20 at 1am PST (10am CEST).

Participants are not expected to stay up 24 hours, but rather to participate in their own normal work hours.

== Where ==

Coordination over all will happen one the #opendaylight IRC channel on Freenode.

In order to facilitate collaboration that may require screen sharing or voice, there are five Webexes available for folks to use for collaboration.
Since a Webex cannot last longer than 12 hours, there is a '1st Half' and '2nd Half' for each one:
