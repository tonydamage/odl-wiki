[[description]]
== Description

* Overview:

The goal of this library is to provide access to RFC-2385 TCP MD5
Signature Option on operating systems which support it in their TCP
stack. This option has been historically used to protect BGP sessions,
but is equally useful for protecting PCEP sessions.

* Design Architecture:

TCPMD5:Helium_Developer_Guide

* Configuration:

BGP_LS_PCEP:TCP_MD5_Guide

[[how-to-test]]
== How to test

* How to setup feature test:

Start full integration Karaf build with only odl-restconf in
bootFeatures. Let Robot install additional feature(s) interactively.
There is not enough functionality for system tests without BGP or PCEP,
therefore basic TCPMD5 test cases will be added as extensions to basic
PCEP suite.

* How to execute basic test cases to validate the feature's
functionality
1.  (Run entire basic PCEP suite without passwords.)
2.  Start pcc-mock (reconnecting mode): 1 pcc, 1 lsp, password set, see
pcep-topology stays empty.
3.  Use restconf to change PCEP configuration to use a wrong password,
pcep-topology stays empty.
4.  Change ODL PCEP configuration to use the correct password,
pcep-topology shows the lsp.
5.  Update the lsp, see a change in pcep-topology.
6.  Change ODL PCEP configuration to not use password, pcep-topology
empties, kill mock-pcc.

Details of test cases will be provided after Robot implementation
becomes ready.

[[performancescalability-concerns]]
== Performance/Scalability Concerns

Performance and scalability suites will come after basic suite is done,
as extensions to PCEP suites. Results are not expected to differ
significantly from no-password case.
