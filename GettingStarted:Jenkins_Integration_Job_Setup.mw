== Introduction ==

The purpose of this job is to perform integration testing when a project that your project depends on changes.  So if projectA depends on projectB, the project A jenkins would have a job
projectA-projectB-integration.  This is accomplished by having the integration Jenkins job poll every 10 minutes to see if the build number for the latest merge build from project B has changed.

== Caveats ==

'''Note:''' to complete these steps you will need to be a committer on the project for which you are doing it.

'''Note:''' in all examples given below, '''repo_name''' is used a stand in for the repo name of your project and
'''project_name''' is the name of your project. "dependent_repo_name" is the name of the repo of a project you depend on.  Please substitute appropriately.

'''Note:''' For the deployment to Nexus to work the groupid in all of your projects pom.xml files must be 

<groupid>org.opendaylight.repo_name</groupid>

due to permission restrictions on Nexus.  If you need to do something different, please contact helpdesk@opendaylight.org.
