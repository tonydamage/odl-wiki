== Introduction ==

The purpose of this job is to perform integration testing when a project that your project depends on changes.  So if projectA depends on projectB, the project A jenkins would have a job
projectA-projectB-integration.  This is accomplished by having the integration Jenkins job poll every 10 minutes to see if the build number for the latest merge build from project B has changed.
