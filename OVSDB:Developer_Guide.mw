The OpenStack integration architecture uses the following technologies:

* RFC 7047 [http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7047/ OVSDB Open vSwitch Database] 
* Both OpenFlow v1.3 and v1.0
* OpenStack ML2 Plugin

View the following video to see a tutorial using the OVSDB ML2 integration with OpenFlow v1.0. Since we have just finished OpenFlow v1.3 integration a screencast is still pending.
