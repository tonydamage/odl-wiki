:*UPLL is started from lgcnwd daemon during startup of [[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):VTN_Coordinator|VTN coordinator]].
:*Interacts with [[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Transaction Coordinator|TC]], [[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Unified Provider Physical Layer (UPPL)|UPPL]] and [[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):OpenDaylight Controller Driver (ODC Driver)|ODC Driver]] using IPC framework.
:*Receives virtual network configuration Create/Update/Delete/Read requests from [[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):VTN_API#VTN_Service_Java_API_library|VTN service]].
:*Maintains the startup, candidate, and running configurations and state information in an external database
:*Performs the Setup/Commit/Abort operations as instructed by [[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Transaction Coordinator|TC]].
:*Connects to southbound controllers via [[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):OpenDaylight Controller Driver (ODC Driver)|ODC Driver]].
:*Constructs and maintains the virtual network topology using the configuration and notifications (events and alarms) received from controller platforms.
