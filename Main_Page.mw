'''Welcome to the OpenDaylight Developer Wiki'''

This wiki contains all of the developer level information for the OpenDaylight Project.  You will need an [https://identity.opendaylight.org account] if you would like to contribute to this wiki or the components of the OpenDaylight Project.  As components are being proposed for inclusion in the project and added to the software repository, we are adding the documentation for each component as it has been provided by the contributor.  These contributions and their documentation are either in the project lifecycle state of "Bootstrap" or "Incubation" (as identified below).  As the projects graduate from these early lifecycle states to more mature states, their associated wiki documentation will also become more mature and integrated.

* A self-organized group with several primary speakers who will be presenting on a variety of user or developer topics
* Potentially have a "social hour" for impromptu conversations and expanding the base of people involved
* Subgroups can gather in a corner to work on specific code, a configuration, or other technical topic that they have in common
* OpenDaylight will fund $12.50/person* ($250 max per meet-up*) and provide a checklist to help with planning  (*''pre-approval needed'')
