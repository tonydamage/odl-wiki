Getting started with OpenDaylight Toolkit on Mac

Rough draft
== Getting Started ==
=== Prerequisites ===
* ensure [https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ xcode] is installed on your mac so you have git
* ensure [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html java] is installed (jdk 7 or later)
* ensure [http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi maven] is installed
== Steps ==
# git clone https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/p/toolkit.git
# cd toolkit
# mvn install (this may take a while since you're downloading the entire opendaylight controller)
# cd samples/simple
# mvn install
# cd ../.. (to back to toolkit root directory)
# cd main/target/main-osgipackage/opendaylight
# ./run.sh -console

The controller may take anywhere from a minute to a few minutes to start. Then go to http://localhost:8080/ and you should be able to login OpenDaylight Toolkit with simple App accessible from the overlay menu.

TODO: developing simple app using nodejs scripts
