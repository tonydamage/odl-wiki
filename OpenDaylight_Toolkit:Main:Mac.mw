Getting started with OpenDaylight Toolkit on Mac

Rough draft
== Getting Started ==
=== Prerequisites ===
* ensure [https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ xcode] is installed on your mac so you have git
* ensure [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html java] is installed (jdk 7 or later)
* ensure [http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi maven] is installed
=== Steps ===
# git clone https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/p/toolkit.git
# cd toolkit
# mvn install (this may take a while since you're downloading the entire opendaylight controller)
# cd samples/simple
# mvn install
# cd ../.. (to back to toolkit root directory)
# cd main/target/main-osgipackage/opendaylight
# ./run.sh -console

The controller may take anywhere from a minute to a few minutes to start. Then go to http://localhost:8080/ and you should be able to login OpenDaylight Toolkit with simple App accessible from the overlay menu.

== App Development==
To provision simple app development workspace
=== Prerequisites ===
* ensure [http://nodejs.org/ nodejs] is installed on your mac
=== Steps ===
# Ensure OpenDaylight controller is running in the background (refer to section above)
# Ensure you are in the toolkit project root directory
# cd kit
# npm install (this will install the necessary node modules)
# node provision.js --scaffold <your-ip> (find out your ip address by using the ifconfig command from your mac's terminal, if you're not sure try localhost)
# cd .. (to go back to the toolkit project root directory)
# cd tool/node
# npm install
# node server.js

Then go to http://localhost:8000/ and you should be able to develop the simple application from there. You can start in samples/simple/src/main/resources/js/app.js. If your setup doesn't work, then try scaffolding again with a different IP address.
