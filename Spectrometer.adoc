[[introduction]]
= Introduction

http://spectrometer.opendaylight.org/?metric=commits&release=all&project_type=all[Spectrometer]
is a fork of the OpenStack
https://github.com/stackforge/stackalytics[Stackalytics] project. It's
goal is to provide insight in to the contributions of the OpenDaylight
community in a transparent fashion. Spectrometer inherits Stackalytics
promise to provide "transparent and meaningful" statistics...
Transparency is important so that the community can have confidence that
all calculations are correct and fair. So "transparent" means that
anyone can double check the methods of calculation Spectrometer uses.
Meanwhile, results must be meaningful to be useful. "Meaningful" means
that anyone may submit a correction that will adjust the influence of
appropriate statistical data. For example, auto-generated code, mass
renaming, automatic refactoring, auto-generated config files, and so on
can artificially inflate various statistics. Spectrometer makes it
possible to avoid these problems as they're discovered.

[[description]]
= Description

Spectrometer is a service that collects and processes development
activity data such as commits, lines of code changed, and code reviews
and presents this in a convenient web dashboard. The Spectrometer
dashboard makes it possible to view data by project, company,
contributor, and other factors.

The primary data sources for Stackalytics are the OpenDaylight Git
repositories and the Gerrit review history.

[[how-to-submit-changes]]
= How to submit changes

Throughout this document you will find each section has a link to
particular file that is hosted in
https://github.com/dave-tucker/spectrometer[GitHub]. To make changes to
the documents submit a
https://github.com/dave-tucker/spectrometer/pulls[GitHub Pull Request]
back against the linked file.

*NOTE*: the data listed is not live data so it does not represent
reality but is representative of the data structures in play.

[[git-commits-history]]
= Git commits history

Spectrometer process three major metrics for OpenDaylight contribution:

* Number of commits
* Number of modified files
* Number of modified lines

Basic code related statistics are retrieved from the output of the
following command:

`git log --pretty="commit_id:'%H%ndate:%at%nauthor:%an%nauthor_email:%ae%nsubject:%s%nmessage:%b%n'" --shortstat -M --no-merges`

The output from this command looks something like this:

`commit_id:b5a416ac344160512f95751ae16e6612aefd4a57` +
`date:1369119386` +
`author:Akihiro MOTOKI` +
`author_email:motoki@da.jp.nec.com` +
`subject:Remove class-based import in the code repo` +
message:Fixes[`message:Fixes`]` bug 1167901` +
`This commit also removes backslashes for line break.` +
`Change-Id: Id26fdfd2af4862652d7270aec132d40662efeb96` +
`diff_stat:` +
`21 files changed, 340 insertions(+), 408 deletions(-)`

This commit changes 21 files and 340 + 408 = 748 LOC (Line Of Code).
I.e. LOC is a sum of insertions and deletions.

[[company-affiliation]]
= Company affiliation

Company affiliation for each commit author is determined according to
the following rules:

* First Spectrometer checks the domain of author email. If the domain is
in the Spectrometer configuration file
(https://github.com/dave-tucker/spectrometer/blob/master/etc/default_data.json[default_data.json]),
then the affiliation for the commit is determined based on the email
address.
* If the email domain doesn't provide enough information then the commit
is affiliated with *independent

The OpenDaylight LDAP ID is used as a primary key for further author
identification. Stackalytics stores profiles for known contributors in
the same configuration file
(https://github.com/dave-tucker/spectrometer/blob/master/etc/default_data.json[default_data.json]).
This profile has a historical list of contributor affiliations. For
example:

`   {` +
`      "user_name": "Dave Tucker",` +
`      "ldap_id": "davetucker",` +
`      "companies": [` +
`        {` +
`          "company_name": "Hewlett-Packard",` +
`          "end_date": "2014-Apr-21"` +
`        },` +
`        {` +
`          "company_name": "RedHat",` +
`          "end_date": null` +
`        }` +
`      ],` +
`      "emails": [` +
`        "dave@dtucker.co.uk",` +
`        "dave.j.tucker@hp.com",` +
`        "djt@redhat.com"` +
`      ]` +
`   }`

[[gerrit-reviews-history]]
= Gerrit reviews history

Gerrit provides a command line interface for retrieval of review source
data. Authorized users can connect to git.opendaylight.org via ssh and
execute the following command:

`gerrit query --all-approvals --patch-sets --format JSON module branch:master limit:100`

This command outputs a list of the latest reviews on the module.
Spectrometer parses this information and stores it in run-time storage.
The web front end pools run-time storage for any new records and changes
in existing records, and retrieves data into memory for real-time
processing.

Spectrometer provides the following analytics for reviews:

* Number of reviews
* Statistics of positive and negative reviews
* Ratio of positive to negative reviews.

[[mailing-list-activity]]
= Mailing list activity

Spectrometer polls mailing list activity via the web-based OpenDaylight
archives. In the Spectrometer dashboard, mailing list activity is
presented in the same way as commits and reviews. Spectrometer searches
the following places to choose the OpenStack module to which an email is
related, in order:

* Module name in brackets in email subject
* Module name without brackets in email subject

If none of the above locations yields a known module, the email is
attributed to the 'unknown' module. The list of tracked web pages with
mail archives is managed in
https://github.com/dave-tucker/spectrometer/blob/master/etc/default_data.json[default_data.json]
under the section marked 'mail_lists'.

[[commit-metrics-corrections-and-a-common-sense-approach]]
= Commit metrics corrections and a common sense approach

LOC is an unreliable metric as it can be easily skewed by large scale
renaming and refactoring.

Spectrometer provides a framework for a community-driven correction
process. It works as follows:

Corrections are stored in the
[https://github.com/dave-tucker/spectrometer/blob/master/etc/corrections.json[corrections.json]
JSON file in the Spectrometer repo.

These corrections look something like this:

\{

`  "corrections": [` +
`      {` +
`          "commit_id": "ee3fe4e836ca1c81e50a8324a9b5f982de4fa97f",` +
`          "correction_comment": "Reset LOC to 0",` +
`          "lines_added": 0,` +
`          "lines_deleted": 0` +
`      }` +
`  ]`

}

The structure of these records is self-descriptive, and any OpenDaylight
contributor can file a bug and provide a patchset for this file in order
to apply a particular correction. This patchset goes through the
standard review process and as soon as it merges into the upstream
project, the changes are immediately visible in the Spectrometer data.
Note that this process is driven by the community and should not be used
for improper manipulation of statistics. Corrected commits are marked
with comments in RED in the web dashboard and are fully transparent,
should anyone else wish to make further challenges.

This framework was designed in order to make statistical data more
reliable and representative. The following common sense approach should
be used:

* Commits that contain auto-generated files should be adjusted in order
to represent the amount of effort actually produced by the contributor,
not including generated output.
* Commits that contain the result of automatic code refactoring should
be adjusted accordingly.
* Commits that are the result of improperly renamed files (shell rename
instead of git rename) should be zeroed.
* Commits with binary and 3rd party files should adjusted accordingly.

[[tracked-projects-and-classification]]
= Tracked projects and classification

Spectrometer is able to track any project that uses the standard
OpenDaylight development infrastructure of Git and Gerrit. Stackalytics
stores a list of projects in its main config file. Any OpenDaylight
contributor can file a bug and provide a patchset for the addition of an
untracked project. The repos section represents the list of tracked
projects. It has the following format:

A projects status in the project lifecycle is gathered from the
[https://github.com/dave-tucker/spectrometer/blob/master/etc/programs.yaml[programs.yaml]
file. The groups used are as follows:

* Incubated - has property incubated-since
* Bootstrap - has property bootstrapped-since
* Mature - has property mature-since
* Core - has property core-since
* Other - all other projects
