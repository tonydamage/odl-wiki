Model-Driven SAL (MD-SAL) is set of infrastructure services aimed for providing common and generic
support to application and plugin developers.

MD-SAL currently provides infrastructure services for:

* Data Services
* RPC / Service routing
* Notification subscription and publish services

This common model-driven infrastructure allows developers of applications and plugins
to develop against an  API type of their choice (Java generated APIs, DOM APIs, REST APIs)
and have other API types provided automatically by the infrastructure.

The modelling language of choice for MD-SAL is YANG, which is IETF standard for modelling
network element configuration. Support for YANG is provided by YANGTools project
and their development tools.
