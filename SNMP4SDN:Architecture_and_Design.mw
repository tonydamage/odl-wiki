== Features ==
* OpenDayLight SAL plugin
* Support SNMP & CLI as the south bound protocol to enable Ethernet switch on the SDN paradigm
* New mechanisms for switch discovery and topology discovery for Ethernet switch in SDN

== Overview ==
We propose a southbound plugin that can control the off-the-shelf commodity Ethernet switches for the purpose of building SDN using Ethernet switches. For Ethernet switches, forwarding table and ACL are where one can install the flow configuration on, and this is done via SNMP and CLI in the proposed plugin. In addition, extensions to the SAL configuration APIs are needed to provide additional API to support some settings, e.g. disabling STP and flooding, etc, which are required for Ethernet switches in SDN.
