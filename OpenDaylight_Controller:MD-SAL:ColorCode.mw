=Overview=

This is MD-SAL sample application for augmenting a model. 

Node Connectors have been augmented to have a "color" property.<br>
Flows (OutputActions to be specific) have been augmented with a "color" property. <br>
Colored flows will only travel along the same-colored node connectors.  For example. flows with color "red" will only go along node connectors with color "red."<br>

<br>
'''FlowWriterService''' adds packet forwarding (mac-to-mac) flows to the MD-SAL data tree.<br>


=How to run ColorCode=

* Setup mininet
* Copy model and impl jars to plugins directory
* Start opendaylight using '''openflowplugin''' distribution (not controller)
* Start mininet with a topology of your choice. For eg:
:<source>sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=<controller_ip> --topo linear,2 --switch ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow13</source>
* Add color to a node-connector
:<source>example restconf call</source>
* Add colored flow
:<source>example restconf call</source>
