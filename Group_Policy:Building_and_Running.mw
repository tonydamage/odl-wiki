This page describes how to build and run the group policy plugin.

== Building ==
 git clone https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/groupbasedpolicy
 mvn clean install package

You'll also need to base controller distribution for the MD-SAL dependency.  The simplest way is to build the controller project:
 git clone https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/controller
 mvn clean install package -DskipTests

== Running ==
The controller distribution build will create a directory called controller/opendaylight/distribution/opendaylight/target/distribution.opendaylig-osgipackage/opendaylight.  Inside is a directory called plugins and a directory called configuration/initial.  Symbolically link groupbasedpolicy/groupbasedpolicy/target/groupbasedpolicy-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar into the plugins directory.  Then also symbolically link groupbasedpolicy/groupbasedpolicy/src/main/resources/configuration/initial/10-groupbasedpolicy.xml into the configuration/initial directory.

Now you can start ODL with ./run.sh.  It will start huge amounts of unneeded cruft when you do this.  In the future, we'll need to create a distribution containing just what's needed for groupbasedpolicy.
