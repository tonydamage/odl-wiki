This page describes how to build and run the group policy plugin.

== Building ==
 mkdir -p ~/work
 cd ~/work
 git clone https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/groupbasedpolicy
 cd groupbasedpolicy
 mvn clean install package

You'll also need to base controller distribution for the MD-SAL dependency.  The simplest way is to build the controller project:
 mkdir -p ~/work
 cd ~/work
 git clone https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/controller
 cd controller
 mvn clean install package -DskipTests

== Running ==
The controller distribution build will create a distribution package in controller/opendaylight/distribution/.  Inside is a directory called plugins and a directory called configuration/initial.  Symbolically link the group based policy bundle into the plugins directory, and the group based policy configuration file into the configuration directory.

 cd ~/work/controller/opendaylight/distribution/opendaylight/target/distribution.opendaylight-osgipackage/opendaylight/plugins
 ln -sf ~/work/groupbasedpolicy/groupbasedpolicy/target/groupbasedpolicy-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar .
 cd ../configuration/initial/
 ln -sf ~/work/groupbasedpolicy/groupbasedpolicy/src/main/resources/configuration/initial/10-groupbasedpolicy.xml .
 cd ../..

Now you can start ODL with ./run.sh.  It will start huge amounts of unneeded cruft when you do this.  In the future, we'll need to create a distribution containing just what's needed for groupbasedpolicy.

  cd ~/work/controller/opendaylight/distribution/opendaylight/target/distribution.opendaylight-osgipackage/opendaylight/
 ./run.sh
