= Welcome to the Google Summer of Code Ideas Page for OpenDaylight =
This page is meant to connect OpenDaylight Projects and their Mentors with students interested in working on OpenDaylight as part of the Google Summer of Code (GSoC).

== For Projects and Mentors == 
* Read the GSoC Mentor's guide to become familiar with what it means to mentor a student as part of the GSoC program -  [http://en.flossmanuals.net/GSoCMentoring Link To GSoC Mentor's Guide]
* Each project proposed must have two Mentors identified.  Mentors are expected to spend around 10 hours per week mentoring their student participants.
* Provide the Mentor's Names, Project Title, and  a General Description of the project you would like to have a student perform below in the "Ideas" section.  Each "Project" should be able to be completed in about 12 weeks.  Students will use this description to decide if they want to apply to work with you and OpenDaylight on the project you propose.  If you wish, you can also list a "blue-sky" project where the Student can come up with the project idea and you will help mentor them through task's design and implementation.

== For Students ==
* Please review the ideas below and if something sounds interesting, please apply to participate with us.

== Ideas ==
The following are running ideas for GSoC Projects

=== Automated Cluster Testing ===
* '''Mentors:''' Mathieu Lemay <mlemay@inocybe.com>
* '''Title:''' Enhance current testing automation to add testing of various multinode cluster configurations. 
* '''Description:''' Working with the integration testing group, write automated devops test for a variety of different cluster and deployment configurations (1-N nodes) which includes a variety of OpenStack+OpenDaylight configurations.

=== TR-069 Southbound Protocol ===
* '''Mentors:''' Mathieu Lemay <mlemay@inocybe.com>
* '''Title:''' Implement a Southbound TR-069 protocol server used to initially provision legacy CPE devices
* '''Description:''' Many DSL or FTTH CPE which are using IP are using TR-069 for provisioning. Use the TR-069 Southbound will allow to provision some legacy CPE that are not OpenFlow based.

=== OF Config Southbound Protocol Tests ===
* '''Mentors:''' Mathieu Lemay <mlemay@inocybe.com>
* '''Title:''' Implement good provisioning interactions via OF Config as an alternative for OVSDB in some current scenarios
* '''Description:''' Working with the LINC, provision logical switches and proper configuration using OFConfig southbound. 
'''Not sure about the state of OF Config support in Hydrogen, please correct if wrong 
'''

=== Consistency/Clustering ===
* '''Mentors:''' Colin Dixon <ckd@us.ibm.com> and Ryan Moats <rmoats@us.ibm.com>
* '''Title:''' Enhance OpenDaylight's Consistency/Clustering APIs and Implementation
* '''Description:''' Explore options for providing enhanced scale-out, clustering, and consistency features and implement them. At a high level, this involves replacing or improving both the Infinispan-based solution and IClustering contract we currently have.

=== Better Host Tracking ===
* '''Mentors:''' Colin Dixon <ckd@us.ibm.com>
* '''Title:''' Create a Better Host Tracker
* '''Description:''' Improve learning of hosts and their locations to work from traffic other than ARP. See [[D-E Proposal:Host Tracker Plan|this page]] for more details.

=== Continuous Performance Testing ===
* '''Mentors:''' Colin Dixon <ckd@us.ibm.com> and Muthukumaran Kothandaraman <mkothand@in.ibm.com>
* '''Title:''' Add Test to Provide Continuous Feedback on Performance
* '''Description:''' See [[GettingStarted:Performance_Integration_Tests|this page]] for more details.

=== jQuery-like Interface for MD-SAL ===
* '''Mentors:''' Ryan Moats <rmoats@us.ibm.com> and Colin Dixon <ckd@us.ibm.com>
* '''Title:''' Add jQuery-like Interface for MD-SAL
* '''Description:''' At its core, MD-SAL is a DOM generated from YANG models.  As such, an interface that provides jQuery-like features would support more robust programming and wrapping than raw manipulation of the underlying DOM.

== Template/Sample ==
* '''Title:''' Provide a short but descriptive title of what the project is
* '''Description:''' Provide at least two or three paragraphs describing the task.  Include the problem/opportunity in need of effort, as well as a description of the task to fix the problem or realize the opportunity.  If there is a probable implementation path... "this will need steps X, Y, and Z to be completed" please describe it.  If part of the task is evaluating one or more potential implementation paths and selecting/executing on one of them, please describe the options and the potential paths to be explored.
* '''Desirable Skills:'''  List both the skills needed and the tools to be used.  ie. Java programing  with working knowledge of OpenStack Neutron and the principals behind SDN, Openflow, and network overlays.  Experience with mininet and wireshark will also be very helpful.
* '''Difficultly:''' Easy/Medium/Hard
* '''Mentors:''' John Doe <john.doe@notarealemailaddress.com>, Jane Smith <JSmith@alsonotarealaddress.com>
