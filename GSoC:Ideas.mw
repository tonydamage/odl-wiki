= Welcome to the Google Summer of Code Ideas Page for OpenDaylight =
This page is meant to connect OpenDaylight Projects and their Mentors with students interested in working on OpenDaylight as part of the Google Summer of Code (GSoC).

== For Projects and Mentors == 
* Read the GSoC Mentor's guide to become familiar with what it means to mentor a student as part of the GSoC program -  [http://en.flossmanuals.net/GSoCMentoring Link To GSoC Mentor's Guide]
* Each project proposed must have two Mentors identified.  Mentors are expected to spend around 10 hours per week mentoring their student participants.
* Provide the Mentor's Names, Project Title, and  a General Description of the project you would like to have a student perform below in the "Ideas" section.  Each "Project" should be able to be completed in about 12 weeks.  Students will use this description to decide if they want to apply to work with you and OpenDaylight on the project you propose.  If you wish, you can also list a "blue-sky" project where the Student can come up with the project idea and you will help mentor them through task's design and implementation.

== For Students ==
* Please review the ideas below and if something sounds interesting, please apply to participate with us.

== Ideas ==
The following are running ideas for GSoC Projects

=== Consistency/Clustering ===
* '''Mentors:''' Colin Dixon <ckd@us.ibm.com>
* '''Title:''' Enhance OpenDaylight's Consistency/Clustering APIs and Implementation
* '''Description:''' Explore options for providing enhanced scale-out, clustering, and consistency features and implement them. At a high level, this involves replacing or improving the Infinispan-based solution we currently have.

=== Sample ===
* '''Mentors:''' John Doe <john.doe@notarealemailaddress.com>, Jane Smith <JSmith@alsonotarealaddress.com>
* '''Title:''' Testing the REST API Of OpenDaylight Hydrogen
* '''Description:''' Using Robot and other automated testing tools, complete the buildout of full combinatorial coverage of all REST APIs in existance within OpenDaylight's Hydrogen release.
