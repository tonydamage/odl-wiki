= Overload protection in the OpenFlow Plugin

(With inputs from Michal Rehak) +
Overload protection in the OF Plugin works in the following way: +

1.  The ConnectionConductor is the source from where all incoming
messages are pushed to queues for async processing. It is the part of
the OFPlugin closest to OFJava, and has on*Message methods (listeners to
incoming messages).The ConnectionConductorImpl pushes messages to the
QueueKeeper. Every ConnectionConductor has a local instance of the
QueueKeeper. +

::
  ;;
    The QueueKeeper has two queues:
    +
    -- Unordered (for packetIn messages)
    +
    -- Ordered (for other messages)
    +
    Both are limited and blocking.
  +
  2. If a particular queue is full, the messages pushed to it will be
  dropped. Upon a successful push, the harverster is pinged to rouse it
  from hibernation. +
  +
  3. A QueueZipper wraps the two queues, and provides the poll method.
  This poll method rotates regularly through the underlying queues. If
  the currently polled queue is empty, it polls the next queue. (See
  QueueKeeperFairImpl). +
  +
  4. Each QueueKeeper gets registered by the QueueKeeperHarvester. The
  Harvester runs upon one thread; iterates through all the registered
  QueueKeepers; and polls them. The polled message is then queued into
  the QueueProcessor.
  +
  ;;
    If all the registered queueKeepers are empty, the harverster
    hibernates. +
  +
  5. At the QueueProcessor are several threads translating messages from
  OFJava-API models to MD-SAL models (preserving order). The
  QueueProcessor uses two threadPools:
  +
  ;;
    -- One threadPool to process the queue items
    +
    -- Another threadPool (containing one thread) to publish messages to
    the MD-SAL
    +
    A queue gets filled for different reasons: +
    : -- The MD-SAL is overloaded +
    : -- A node is flooding or generally something slowed down the
    processing pipeline. +

If the queue in the QueueProcessor is full, it blocks the harvester. If
the harvester is blocked, the queues in the QueueKeeper will not be
emptied. +
*Note*: The current implementation of the feature offers no checking of
the memory or cpu load to actively throttle messages.

[[effects-of-overload-protection]]
== Effects of overload protection

* When a node floods the controller, it will not block messages from
other nodes.
* The processing of messages is fair. Floody node messages are neither
prioritized nor do they infest queues outside the ConnectionConductor.
* Memory is not used up on the controller side as messages gets dropped
immediately upon an unsuccessful push to the local queue.
* The functionality cannot create back pressure at the netty level as
pressure affects the echo message, and might cause a connection close
action on the switch side.
