'''Executors:'''

* ''sal-binding-notification'' Executor 
** 4-32 Threads
** Limited configurable blocking queue
** Leaked to clients by directly invoking callbacks
* ''sal-binding-commit'' Executor - 
* 1 Thread
** unbounded
** Leaked to clients by directly invoking callbacks, via ListenableFuture

==== RPC Invocations ===

Callback to RPC implementation is done via caller's thread. No context switch is present here.
Implementations (providers) are expected to return future object with result as soon as possible
and do NOT block thread for significant amount of time. Callback should end immediatelly with
Future which should be updated once result is available.
