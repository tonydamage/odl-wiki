The Aggregator provides functionality for aggregating nodes in
topologies based on some similarity e.g. _IP-address_. It is processing
changes in all intended topologies and searching for the nodes which
satisfy the condition set for the current aggregation. Output from the
Aggregator are changes from previous state e.g. created, updated and
removed data.

[[process-created-changes]]
== Process Created Changes

1.  The Aggregator is comparing the newly created nodes in the topology
with the existing ones by the given condition.
2.  If found one then it checks if there exists some aggregated node
with the same success in the condition.
1.  If yes then it adds newly created node in the topology to that
aggregated node.
2.  If not then it creates a new aggregated node.

[[process-removed-changes]]
== Process Removed Changes

1.  The Aggregator is comparing the newly removed nodes in the topology
with the existing ones in the aggregated topology by the given
condition.
2.  If found one then it checks from how many nodes the aggregated node
consists of.
1.  If more than two then it removes the newly removed point in the
topology from the aggregated node.
2.  If only two then it removes the whole aggregated node from the
aggregated topology.

[[process-updated-changes]]
== Process Updated Changes

1.  THe Aggregator is comparing the newly updated nodes in the topology
with the existing ones in the aggregated topology by the given
condition.
2.  If found one then it processes the _Created Changes_ and then
_Removed Changes_ methods

= Typical case

1.  _TopoRequestHandler_ instantiate the _TopologyAggregator_ class
2.  For each _topology_ presented in the configuration request (taken
from TopoRequestHandler) the initialization is made.
3.
