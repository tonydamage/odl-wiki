TopoProcessingProvider is entry point for Topology Processing Framework.
It requires DataBroker instance. DataBroker is needed for listener
registrations. There is TopologyRequestListener which listens on
aggregated topology requests (placed into configuration datastore) and
UnderlayTopologyListeners which listen on underlay topology data changes
(made in operational datastore). TopologyRequestHandler saves
toporequest data and provides method for translating path to the
specified leaf. When a change in topology occurs, registered
UnderlayTopologyListener processes this information for further
aggregation and/or filtration. Finally, after overlay topology is
created, it is passed to TopologyWriter, which writes this topology into
operational datastore.

[[typical-usecase]]
= Typical usecase

[0] TopoProcessingProvider instance is created, DataBroker dependency is
set +
[1] TopoProcessingProvider registers TopologyRequestListener (into
configuration datastore) +
: - TopologyRequestListener listens on any topology creation or deletion
and checks if it contains CorrelationAugment augmentation +
[2] TopologyRequestListener creates TopologyRequestHandler on new
topology request +
: - TopologyRequestHandler translates paths from correlation into
InstanceIdentifiers +
[3] TopologyRequestHandler creates TopologyFiltrator and/or
TopologyAggregator (depending on correlation) +
[4] This step shows, that we can create filtered views on aggregated
topologies +
[5] TopologyRequestHandler registers needed UnderlayTopologyListener(s)
(into operational datastore) +
[6] Data change events are passed for aggregation and/or filtering +
[7] Overlay topology is passed to TopologyWriter +
[8] TopologyWriter writes the overlay topology into operational
datastore +
