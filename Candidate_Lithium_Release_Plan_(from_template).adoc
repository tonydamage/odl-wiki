[[introduction]]
== Introduction

The Group Based Policy project proposes the following additions to the
Lithium release:

* Added the Exception repository.
* Added the Operation State repository.
* More modularized features. There currently are only two features
defined for The groupbasedpolicy project:
odl-groupbasedpolicy-ofoverlay, and
odl-integration-compatible-with-groupbasedpolicy. These two features
will be deprecated in favor of a more modular set of features.
* Support for feature-loadable renderers. This will allow the desired
renderer to be loaded and used. Note that the Lithium release only
supports a single renderer at a time.
* Support for OpFlex renderer.
* Support or Plugin to OpenContrail renderer.
* Integration with OpenStack Group Based Policy.
* New version of the policy YANG model (fixes errors in the YANG model).

In addition, the policy model from the Helium release will be deprecated
in support of the new one (see above), and the features supported in
Helium will also be deprecated in support of a more modular set

[[externally-consumable-apis]]
== Externally Consumable APIs

* Please list and describe all externally consumable APIs or point to a
document that does so.
* This need not be a list of all java interfaces and yang files, but
should be a list of high-level functionality, e.g., flow programming.
** For each such API, there should be a list of the bundles providing
the API, but not necessarily the implementation.
* Each PROVISIONAL or TENTATIVE API must be listed as project
deliverable
** Must be declared as "IN" or "OUT" at the M3 Milestone

[[expected-incompatibilities-with-other-projects]]
== Expected Incompatibilities with Other Projects

This OpenFlow Overlay renderer is considered incompatible with
applications that program the flow tables on vSwitches. This includes:

* VTN
* OVSDB
* OpenDOVE

The OpenFlow Overlay renderer attempts to install flows in the flow
tables of vSwitches when policy is resolved in order to create a Network
Virtualization solution. The applications listed above also provide this
functionality, and therefore are incompatible.

These projects have not held discussions as to how to become compatible
because they each provide their own solution to the same problem.

[[compatibility-with-previous-releases]]
== Compatibility with Previous Releases

[[removed-apis-andor-functionality]]
=== Removed APIs and/or Functionality

* No APIs will be removed in this release. There may be a set of APIs
deprecated, based on the need for a YANG model change (changes to ensure
YANG syntactic correctness). This analysis will be done by the M2
milestone.
** Those APIs that are deprecated will have a corresponding API provided
based on the new YANG model. The semantics of the APIs will be
unchanged.
*** Deprecated APIs will be tagged with the `@Deprecated` annotation in
Java for the Lithium release.

[[deprecated-apis-andor-functionality]]
=== Deprecated APIs and/or Functionality

* odl-groupbasedpolicy-ofoverlay feature is deprecated. This feature
will be deprecated, in favor of a more modular approach to features in
Group Based Policy. To support the existing feature, multiple features
must now be loaded. Although the actual features have yet to be
determined, the current plan is for the following features:
** odl-groupbasedpolicy-policy-model
** odl-groupbasedpolicy-endpoint-model
** odl-groupbasedpolicy-policy-rest
** odl-groupbasedpoliyc-endpoint-rest
** odl-groupbasedpolicy-ofoverlay-renderer

[[changed-apis-andor-functionality]]
=== Changed APIs and/or Functionality

* Please include list of a APIs and/or functionality that existed the
previous release and will be changed.
** For each such API/functionality, provide guidance about who will be
affected and how they should adapt.
** In general, project's should strive to be backward compatible with
the previous release and note what functionality will be removed by
deprecating it and noting that with the `@Deprecated` annotations
wherever possible.

[[themes-and-priorities]]
== Themes and Priorities

[[requests-from-other-projects]]
== Requests from Other Projects

For each API request, the requesting project should create an entry like
the example below. After creating the entry, the requesting project
should send an e-mail to release@lists.opendaylight.org, and both
projects' dev lists using this template:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [REQUEST FOR NEW OR EXTENDED API] ${API name}

Note: This email is a request from ${requesting project} for a new or
extended API in ${providing project}.

API Name: ${API name}
Request: ${link to the request in the providing project's release plan}

Please let us know if you will be able to provide this new
functionality by the listed milestone. If you need clarifications or
help in providing the API, let us know so we can reach an agreement.

If you feel that providing this API is a bad idea regardless of where
the resources are coming from, please let us know why and ideally,
suggest and alternative.

== Test Tools Requirements

* Please specify if the project will run System Test (ST) inside
OpenDaylight cloud
* In case affirmative please enumerate any test tool (mininet, etc...)
you think will be required for testing your project
** The goal is to start test tools installation in rackspace as soon as
possible
* In case negative be aware you will be required to provide System Test
(ST) reports upon any release creation (weekly Release, Release
