==Project Name==
Defense4All

==Features==
Defense4All is an SDN application for detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks. It communicates with OpenDaylight Controller via the ODC north-bound REST API to:
# Monitor behavior of protected traffic - the application sets flow entries in selected network locations to read traffic statistics for each of the PNs (aggregating statistics collected for a given PN from multiple locations).
# Divert attacked traffic to selected AMSs – the application set flow entries in selected network locations to divert traffic to selected AMSs. When an attack is over the application removes these flow entries, thus returning to normal operation and traffic monitoring.
Defense4All can optionally dynamically configure defined AMSs, monitor them or collect and act upon attack statistics from them. It contains a reference implementation pluggable driver to communicate with Radware’s DefensePro AMS. Defense4All presents its north-bound REST and CLI APIs to:
# Control and configure the application (runtime parameters, ODC connectivity, AMSs in domain, PNs, etc.).
# Obtain reporting data – operational or security, current or historical, unified from Defense4All and other sources (like ODC, AMSs).

==Issues to be fixed==
* See [[Defense4All:Release_Notes|Release Notes]] for known Issues and Limitations.

==Security Considerations==
Defense4All REST API presently does not check for credentials. Nor does it define user roles according to which usage of certain REST APIs is allowed/restricted.

==Quality Assurance (test coverage, etc)==
Unit tests cover communications with ODC (integration test), usage of Cassandra, and selective set of operations. Additional testcases for functional coverage are planned for next release. Robustness is accomplished via complementary means, such as extensive error handling path, HealthTracker, restartability, etc.  Please refer to [[Defense4All:Continuity|Continuity]] for more details.
