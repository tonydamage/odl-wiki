==Security Considerations==
Defense4All REST API presently does not check for credentials. Nor does it define user roles according to which usage of certain REST APIs is allowed/restricted.

==Quality Assurance (test coverage, etc)==
Unit tests cover communications with ODC (integration test), usage of Cassandra, and selective set of operations. Additional testcases for functional coverage are planned for next release. Robustness is accomplished via complementary means, such as extensive error handling path, HealthTracker, restartability, etc.  Please refer to [[Defense4All:Continuity|Continuity]] for more details.
