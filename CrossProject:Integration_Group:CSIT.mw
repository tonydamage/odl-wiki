== Introduction ==
Continuous System Integration Test (CSIT) area has been created to develop automated system test.

== Test Plans ==
* [[CrossProject:Integration_Group:CSIT_Test_Plan_Base|Base Edition]]
* [[CrossProject:Integration_Group:CSIT_Test_Plan_Virtualization|Virtualization Edition]]
* [[CrossProject:Integration_Group:CSIT_Test_Plan_Service_Provider|Service Provider Edition]]

== Implementation ==

CSIT runs at [[CrossProject:Integration_Group:ODL_Test_Lab|OpenDaylight Lab]]. This test bed is part of the OpenDaylight infrastructure maintained by Linux Foundation.<br/> 

CSIT is implemented through the following jobs in [https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/integration Integration Jenkins]:

* '''integration-deploy-controller-latest-base-edition''' (BUNDLEVERSION, JOBNAME, BUILDNUMBER). This job will:
** Update the controller VM with the base edition artifacts generated by the Jenkins job {JOBNAME }#${BUILDNUMBER} for the release version ${BUNDLEVERSION}
** Start the controller with the new SW

* '''integration-csit''' (BUNDLEVERSION, JOBNAME, BUILDNUMBER, PUSH). This job will perform the system test with the following steps:
** Update controller base edition (integration-deploy-controller-latest-base-edition) according to BUNDLEVERSION, JOBNAME, BUILDNUMBER described above
** Run Robot system test for base edition using Integration test code available at /test/csit/suites/base
** In case system test is passed and ${PUSH}=TRUE, upload release artifacts to Nexus

* '''integration-<project>-integration'''. This job polls the <project> merge builds. When a merge happens this job will:
** Build the OpenDaylight editions (Base, Service Provider, Virtualization)
** Extract the BUNDLEVERSION from the build
** Perform system test (integration-csit) with ${BUNDLEVERSION}=version from previous step, ${JOBNAME}=current jobname, ${BUILDNUMBER}=current build #, ${PUSH)=TRUE

== Code Development ==

System test code is part of our Integration repo. It is stored under /test folder. Here is how to [[CrossProject:Integration_Group:Hack_Code| download and hack the code]].

We also follow the same [[OpenDaylight_Controller:Development_Infrastructure_Overview|flow]] as any other OpenDaylight project, with some difference in the verify and merge jobs:

* '''integration-verify-test'''. This job will trigger on patch creation under /test folder and will:

* '''integration-merge-test'''.  This job will trigger on patch merge under /test folder and will:

== Open Test Lab ==

Open Lab at Ericsson can be booked to debug system test code. Click [[CrossProject:Integration_Group:Test_Lab|here]]. <br/>

We are also working on offering Open Lab VMs for local system test debugging. <br/>
