==Introduction==
HostTracker is an attempt to bring the ideas of the AD-SAL hosttracker and hosttracker_new bundles to the MD-SAL. See below for a guide to pulling and running the MdHostTracker code within the [[L2 Switch:Main|l2switch]] base distribution.

==User Guide==
The HostTracker code is currently hosted on l2switch project, you can clone the code:
    git clone https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/p/l2switch.git
Once you've cloned the code you can build it:
    mvn clean install

You should also be able to import the code to Eclipse with no problems via Import > Existing Maven Project(s), use the pom.xml in the hosttracker's directory (l2switch/hosttracker/pom.xml). If for some reason you get errors resolving generated classes add the generated source path to the project's source directories via Project Preferences > Java Build Path > Source > Add folder... The path you're looking for is ''src/main/yang-gen-code''.

HostTracker depends on the [[L2 Switch:Main|l2switch]] addresstracker for its observations, so we will run within the [[L2 Switch:Main|l2switch]] distribution for testing. 
Build l2switch as you usually would (mvn clean install) and the hosttracker model and implementation bundles are inside the plugins' folder, in the directory:
    ~/path/to/l2switch/distribution/base/target/distributions-l2switch-base-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-osgipackage/opendaylight/

Now you're ready to run the distribution, to test with mininet run
    ./run.sh -start
    sudo mn  --topo single,3 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote
To see learned hosts visit: http://localhost:8080/restconf/operational/host-tracker-service:hosts/
You should see something similar to this:
