= Testing approach =
=== Use Cases ===
With regards to complexity of individual use cases these will be part of testing designs and not of this document. For now we are considering following basic use cases that involve: 

* Setting up connection to switch 
* Receiving messages from switch 
* Processing messages in library
* Passing them to plugin/SAL
* Passing possible response from plugin/SAL back to switch

=== Unit tests ===

Unit tests will be designed as short and fast units. Special attention will be addressed to test failures caused by occupied ports by other automated test processes. Unit tests will cover below areas:
*	Detection of TLS connection
*	Obtaining information about OpenFlow protocol version from the message header  
*	Converting messages into/from binary stream with taking into account right format of converted messages
Types of messages that will be incorporated in unit tests:
*	Hello
*	Features request
*	Features reply
*	Echo request
*	Echo reply
*	Flow modification and flow related messages
*	Various combinations of matches
Tests will be written and administrated using JUnit framework.
