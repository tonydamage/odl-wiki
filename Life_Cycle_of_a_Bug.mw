=Overview=
This page provides an overview of the life cycle for a bug. Specifically, it defines the general process one follows from opening a bug to finally closing the bug after having fixed the issue.

=The Life Cycle=
This is the life cycle in detail.
====You found a bug/issue====
#You find a bug or issue that needs to be addressed!
#*Hopefully you have discussed with others on [[IRC]] or via the Distribution Lists.
#Search for an existing bug on [https://bugs.opendaylight.org/ bugzilla]
#If you don't find an existing bug, then create a new bug

====You are ready to work a bug====
#Search for the bug on [https://bugs.opendaylight.org/ bugzilla].
#Assign it to yourself, and change the state to "In progress".
#Develop your change, and commit them to [https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/ gerrit]. 
#*Please link to the Bug in commit message by using "Bug {$id}" in commit message. Eg. "Bug 1: Fixed typo in comment."
#*''Make sure that if you are not ready for review on your first commit that you make that clear in the subject''
# When your bug is ready update it state in bugzilla to "WAITING_FOR_REVIEW", which clearly signals bugfix is submitted.
#*Wait for a committer on your project to review the code changes
#**Reach out via [[IRC]] if time is pressing, otherwise wait and a committer will look at the source.<br>''Committers for each project are on the right hand side of their home wiki page.''
#*A committer will review and provide comments on the source.
#*Address any comments from the committers
#*Address any jenkins build failures
#*Repeat as necessary
#A committer will give a +2 and merge / deliver the changes into the master.
#Assuming the jenkins build passes, the gerrit ticket will be closed out automatically (moved to "Merged" state).
#You (the developer) closes out the original [https://bugs.opendaylight.org/ bugzilla] ticket.
