The goal of this page is to bring all of our getting started examples into a single place to make it easier for new comers to find their way to useful examples. The following wiki pages provide examples with varying level of detail. Below we list each (known) example, along with a brief description of what it demonstrates.

* [[Ping]] example - demonstrates code generate from a yang file, and how you can use a customer northbound rest API.
* [[OpenDaylight_Controller:MD-SAL:Toaster_Step-By-Step|Toaster Step-By-Step]]
:Demonstrates how to create a singleton service inside of the controller which provides changing operational data, some configuration data, and RPC implementation. It also explains about the necessary changes to pom.xml files to generate source code automatically from the .yang files, and it touches on the config sub-system provided in the controller. Finally it discusses breifly how to interact with the singleton service via the generic RESTCONF interface.
* [[OpenDaylight_Controller:MD-SAL:L2_Switch| L2 Switch Sample]] - Provides an example learning switch based on MD-SAL which optimizes how packets are forwarded.
* [[Ping 2.0 - Discover and Model Plugin]] - An example MD-SAL application which demonstrates how to: Create a singleton service, respond to RPC calls, create Inventory:Nodes:Node , augment created nodes with additional attributes, mount RPC calls and data readers onto a specific node, and listen for changes in a tree and react accordingly.
* http://sdntutorials.com/category/md-sal/ - Small snippets of code illustrating how to perform various small tasks.
