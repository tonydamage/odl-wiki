== Generic Questions ==

=== What is Xtend?  ===

<blockquote>In MD-SAL there are a lot of .xtend files . What are these?</blockquote>

[http://eclipse.org/xtend Xtend] is Java based language which allows for more expresive code, but still during compile phase the xtend compilrer generates 
Java code so there is no performance hit and it has full compatibility with Java.

Xtend is very useful if you need to generate a lot of code, do the templates or write code in more readable form, without very verbose syntax.

===What is the package-info.java file for? ===

The file package-info.java allows to write Javadoc for whole package. It is replacement of package-info.html.

== MD-SAL ==

=== What kind of broker is the request routing broker ? ===

Request Routing Broker is one, which request messages to services based on contents of request – in case of the Controller and Flow Services this is node (switch) on which you want to manipulate flows.

=== Could be a provider a consumer of some other service? ===

Yes, In that case both are considered and implemented as Providers (provider has always access to consumer APIs), ProviderContext is extension of ConsumerContext.

=== Are we required to subclass MD-SAL Activators? ===

<blockquote>Consumer and Producers – Do we need subclass AbstractBindingAwareConsumer AbstractBindingAwareProducer which are the bundle Activators. we usually have 1 Activator for each bundle , how to accomadate 2 activators in a bundle.
</blockquote>

MD-SAL does not require you to subclass AbstractBindingAwareConsumer or AbstractBindingAwareProducer. You could use your own Activator and implement only interface BindingAwareProvider or BindingAwareConsumer, and then register instance of that service to Binding Aware Broker.

<pre>
@Override
public final void start(BundleContext context) throws Exception {
        ServiceReference&lt;BindingAwareBroker&gt; brokerRef = context.getServiceReference(BindingAwareBroker.class);
        BindingAwareBroker broker = context.getService(brokerRef);
        broker.registerProvider(this, context);
}
</pre>
