[[push-and-fix-scenario]]
= Push and fix scenario

Clone, hack and push steps are well explained in
GettingStarted:Pulling,_Hacking,_and_Pushing_All_the_Code_from_the_CLI.

The next phase is review in gerrit. Here suggestions or comments might
be added to pushed code.

Finally the code might be:

* merged
* rebased + merged
* abandoned

Now back to case where code needs to be fixed or changed (inspired by
review comments) - we can use *patch-set* feature of gerrit + *amend*
feature in git.

[[the-easiest-scenario]]
== The easiest scenario

After push you made some additional changes (inspired by review
comments). Now to make the *local commit* run:

`git commit --amend`

Optionally the commit message can be extended by some comments. But
important is that at the end (near signoff line) of message there must
be the change-id line added.

This line can be

* (PREFERED WAY) *generated automatically*
+
::
  requirement: install hook script (commit-msg) for commit message in
  .git/hooks folder (see
  GettingStarted:Pulling,_Hacking,_and_Pushing_All_the_Code_from_the_CLI#Pull_code_via_ssh[
  pull code])
* or can be *retrieved from gerrit* change-page

image:gerrit-changeId.png[gerrit - change id,title="gerrit - change id"]

Resulting commit message will look like this:

`this is message title` +
 +
`message body containing changes details` +
 +
`Signed-off-by: first name ` +
`Change-Id: If517c0e31123b5609511dc3ed90b44d8427b08d6`

Next step is to push changes to gerrit using:

`git push origin HEAD:refs/for/master `

Now gerrit will assign this push as next patch-set to the last push
(with the same change-id).

[[another-scenario-1]]
== Another scenario 1

It might happen, that there are already some more local commits made on
the branch. In case these commits are intended as next independent push
it is easier to *fetch the pushed state* as separate branch
(topicAgain):

`git fetch `https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/controller[`https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/controller`]` refs/changes/.../2 && git checkout -b topicAgain FETCH_HEAD`

And here make the fix and replay the easy scenario. Optionally delete
the branch `git branch -d topicAgain`.

[[another-scenario-2]]
== Another scenario 2

It might happen, that there are already some more local commits made on
the branch. Some of them is intended to fix the push and some of them
are independent. What can be done here is to isolate the fixes into new
branch (topicFixOnly) and *squash* them together with the original
commit:

`git checkout -b topicFixOnly` +
`# the number after HEAD~ is the amount of local commits we want take back and start the rebase. ` +
`# In rebase controll message the alien commit lines should be deleted and fix commit lines should be squashed to the original commit (the one we are fixing) using prefix "s"` +
`git rebase -i HEAD~4`

And here all should be ready for push. Perhaps the presence of change-id
might be checked:

`git log -n 2` +
`# if missing, use ` +
`git commit --amend`

Finally replay the easy scenario. Optionally delete the branch git
branch -d topicFixOnly.

[[best-practices]]
= Best practices

To avoid complications, please consider these:

* do not code on local master, use topic-branch instead (to create
branch based on current state: `git checkout -b myTopic`)
+
::
  if you have local changes already, use `git stash` to store them and
  `git stash pop` to apply them in the new branch
* try to avoid work depending on pushed but not yed merged code (the
code might get changed or even abandoned)
* if you have to use work in progress as base for you code (even your
own), use new branch (based on the last patch-set) and in case that the
base commit changes, rebase your branch accordingly
+
::
  `git fetch https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/controller refs/changes/.../1`
  +
  `git checkout -b myTopicBranch FETCH_HEAD`
  +
  ... patch-set 2 arrived to gerrit ...
  +
  And rebase (while myTopicBranch active):
  +
  `git fetch https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/controller refs/changes/.../2`
  +
  `git rebase -i FETCH_HEAD`
* in case it is too late, you can always recreate local branch
reflecting the base commit and see local changes with respect to this
branch
+
::
  `git fetch https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/controller refs/changes/.../3`
  +
  `git diff FETCH_HEAD`
