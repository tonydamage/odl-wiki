== Introduction

Getting started in OpenDaylight can be a bit intimidating, but most of
the infrastructure vanishes into the background pretty quickly as you
get things set up and used to the workflow.

== New Project Checklist

Here are the tasks you're going to want to do

1.  make sure you have a git repository (visible in gerrit)
1.  Go to https://git.opendaylight.org/[https://git.opendaylight.org/]
2.  Click "Projects" on the left under the OpenDaylight logo
3.  Click "List" under projects
4.  Verify your project is listed with the right repo name
2.  make sure your project has a jenkins jobs configured via Jenkins Job
Builder (JJB)
* To see if you have JJB jobs:
1.  Go to the
`[https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/gitweb?p=releng/builder.git;a=tree;f=jjb;hb=HEAD jjb folder]`
in the releng/builder project.
2.  Look for your project's repo name as a folder and click on it.
3.  Make sure there is a single yaml file in the folder.
4.  If you are missing JJB refer to Step 7 on how to get setup
3.  make sure you have a bugzilla entry for your project
1.  Go to https://bugs.opendaylight.org/[https://bugs.opendaylight.org/]
2.  Click "File a Bug"
3.  Make sure your project appears in the list
4.  make sure you have a mailing list, usually just -dev
1.  Go to
https://lists.opendaylight.org/[https://lists.opendaylight.org/]
2.  Make sure there is a list named `'''<repo-name>'''-dev`
3.  Subscribe to the list with an e-mail you actually check
5.  make a main wiki page using the Project Facts template
1.  The normal title for this page is :Main, e.g., BGP LS PCEP:Main[BGP
LS PCEP:Main]
2.  You should use the Template:Project Facts[Project Facts Template].
Again a good example is BGP LS PCEP:Main[BGP LS PCEP:Main]
6.  make sure you're subscribed to:
* your mailing list (described above) so you get mail about your project
* your gerrit so you can tell when people push patches to your project
(see Communication:Gerrit for how to subscribe to events from your
project)
* at least one representative from your project should either (i) attend
the TSC:Main[TSC calls], (ii) subscribe to the
https://lists.opendaylight.org/mailman/listinfo/tsc[TSC mailing list],
or (iii) read the TSC:Main#Meeting_Minutes[TSC meeting minutes].
** Ideally, a project representative should do all three.
7.  set up your jenkins jobs
* If you are using the JJB central Jenkins silo
1.  Go to
https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/releng/[https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/releng/]
2.  Look for a tab at the top for your project and click on it
3.  Make sure you have at least -verify-master, -merge-master, and
-daily-master jobs
4.  For more information on using the RelEng/Builder JJB setup see the
RelEng:Main[RelEng project page] or the
https://github.com/opendaylight/releng-builder[RelEng/Builder README]
8.  Verify that your jenkins jobs work
* Test verify by pushing a patch and seeing that the verify job runs and
successfully posts a "verified +1" to the gerrit.
* Then merge the patch and make sure that the merge job runs
successfully and pushes artifacts in Nexus.
** After the job runs, go to
http://nexus.opendaylight.org/[http://nexus.opendaylight.org/]
** Search for your project's name and see if the artifacts you expect
are there.
* Optionally, test your integration jobs by manually triggering them.
9.  Set up your pom file structure according to
CrossProject:HouseKeeping_Best_Practices_Group:Project_layout[ project
layout best practice]
* Your project should have a parent pom file that should be the root of
your 'pom tree'
* It's parent should be the odlparent pom file
* All versions/dependencies should be put into one of these two pom
files
10. Set up your JaCoCo code coverage reporting
* see link:#Jacoco_plugin_Setup[Jacoco plugin Setup] below
* currently, this only works for Java
