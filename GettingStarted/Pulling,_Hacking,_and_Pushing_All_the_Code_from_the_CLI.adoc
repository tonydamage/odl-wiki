[[intro]]
== Intro

OpenDaylight has currently 12 projects, each with their own repo. This
page tries to give you a quick start guide to pulling, hacking, and
pushing the code from each of them.

For a quick reference on some commonly used git commands, check out the
link:GIT Cheat Sheet[GIT Cheat Sheet].

[[make-sure-you-have-an-account]]
== Make sure you have an account

While you can pull code anonymously, if you want to push it (or edit the
wiki) you will need to
https://identity.opendaylight.org/carbon/user-registration/index.jsp?region=region1&item=user_registration_menu[get
an account].

[[gerrit-setup]]
== Gerrit Setup

Code reviews are enabled through Gerrit.
OpenDaylight Controller:Gerrit Setup[Set up Gerrit] for use if you wish
to use ssh. If you wish to use https,
OpenDaylight Controller:Setting up HTTP in Gerrit[Set up Gerrit to use
HTTPS].

Note: You will need to perform the
OpenDaylight Controller:Gerrit Setup[Gerrit Setup] before you can access
git via ssh as described below.

[[pull-code-via-git-cli]]
== Pull code via git CLI

Pull the code by cloning the controller repository.

First, all the lines below use the $ODL_USERNAME environment variable,
so your life will be *way* easier of you set it with:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
export ODL_USERNAME=<username for the account you created at OpenDaylight>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then you will want to check out the code from each of the repos for each
project. You can, of course select any one of the projects if you are
only looking for one.

You have two choices for your method of engagement, you can use:

1.  ssh on port 29418 (blocked by some firewalls)
2.  https

[[hack-the-code]]
== Hack the Code

[[build-the-code]]
=== Build the code

Note that the code is structured by project, and each project has its
own subdirectory. You must explicitly enter each subdirectory and build
in that directory to build that project. In the example below, we show
how to build ALL of the projects, but you can just build say the base
controller by entering the controller directory and building there.

You are going to want to increase the memory available to maven, the
settings on the Jenkins build server are:

--------------------------------------------------
export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m"
--------------------------------------------------

Below is the top level build line for each project:

-------------------------------------------
(cd affinity;mvn clean install)
(cd bgpcep;mvn clean install)
(cd controller;mvn clean install)
# Need a line for Defense4All
(cd lispflowmapping;mvn clean install)
# Need a line for OpenDove
(cd openflowjava;mvn clean install)
(cd openflowplugin;mvn clean install)
(cd ovsdb/commons/parent;mvn clean install)
(cd vtn;mvn clean install)
(cd yangtools;mvn clean install)
-------------------------------------------

[[run-the-controller]]
=== Run the controller

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note that the base below runs only the BASE controller project. It does not necessarily invoke other projects that might have been built as they 
sometimes need special command line arguments to invoke. For example, the open flow 1.3 plugin requires a special command line argument 
to invoke. Please refer to each project's wiki for information on this.

cd controller/opendaylight/distribution/opendaylight/target/distribution.opendaylight-osgipackage/opendaylight/
./run.sh
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And point your browser at http://localhost:8080/

There is much much more complete documentation on running the controller
in the OpenDaylight Controller:Installation[Installation Guide].

[[pushing-your-changes]]
== Pushing your changes

[[pull-a-topic-branch]]
=== Pull a topic branch

Your life will be much much happier if you pull topic branch before you
start hacking :) Not only does topic branch eliminate possible unrelated
dependencies so that your patch will no longer be blocked by others'
pending patches, but it would be also easier to filter a topic on
Gerrit, e.g. "topic:featureA". The following command does:

1.  switch to master branch.
2.  pull remote branches to local.
3.  rebase local master branch with remote to work on the latest code
base.
4.  checkout a new topic branch off master and start working on the
topic branch.

------------------------------------
git checkout master
git remote update
git rebase origin/master
git checkout -b <name of your topic>
------------------------------------

[[install-git-review]]
=== Install git-review

Git-review is a great tool to simplify the hassle of using several git
commands to submit a patch for review. Refer to
link:Git-review_Workflow[How to install and push codes with git-review]
After initializing git-review, both commit-msg hook and a remote repo
named gerrit will be created and a patch can be submitted to Gerrit with
a single "git review" command.

[[commit-the-code-via-git-cli]]
=== Commit the code via git CLI

Note: To be accepted, all code must come with a
http://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin[developer certificate
of origin] as expressed by having a Signed-off-by. This means that you
are asserting that you have made the change and you understand that the
work was done as part of an open-source license.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

        By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

        (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
            have the right to submit it under the open source license
            indicated in the file; or

        (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
            of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
            license and I have the right under that license to submit that
            work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
            by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
            permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
            in the file; or

        (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
            person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
            it.

        (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
            are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
            personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
            maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
            this project or the open source license(s) involved.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mechanically you do it this way

--------------------
git commit --signoff
--------------------

or in a shorter version:

-------------
git commit -s
-------------

You will be prompted for a commit message, and if you are fixing a
bugzilla bug, you can add that to your commit message as well and it
will get linked from the Gerrit:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fix for bug 2.

Signed-off-by: Ed Warnicke <eaw@cisco.com>

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
#
#       modified:   README
#
-------------------------------------------------------------------

If you wish to add the signoff to the commit message on your every
commit without the need to specify -s or --signoff, add the following
lines in the end of .git/hooks/commit-msg, after the line
"add_ChangeId":

`  SOB=$(git var GIT_AUTHOR_IDENT | sed -n 's/^`latexmath:[$.*>$]`.*$/Signed-off-by: \1/p')` +
`  grep -qs "^$SOB" "$1" || echo "$SOB" >> "$1"`

Make sure your credentials (name, email) are configured properly in git.
They can be configured by adding the following settings:

`  git config --global user.name "John Doe"` +
`  git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com`

[[pull-the-code-changes-via-git-cli]]
=== Pull the code changes via git CLI

Use the following commands to get the latest changes from the remote
repository

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
git checkout <name of the topic branch you want to work on>
git remote update
git rebase origin/master (or other branches than master: git rebase origin/stable/hydrogen)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[push-the-code-via-git-cli]]
=== Push the code via git CLI

Use git review to push your changes to Gerrit for review.

----------
git review
----------

You will get a message pointing you to your gerrit request like:

-----------------------------------------------------
remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (2/2)
remote: Processing changes: new: 1, refs: 1, done    
remote: 
remote: New Changes:
remote:   http://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/64
remote: 
-----------------------------------------------------

[[first-push]]
=== First push

Usually the project is cloned via anonymous access (https..) and before
first push the *remote gerrit* definition should be fixed (example shows
the *controller* project): Normally, "remote gerrit" will be set when
initializing git-review by "git review -s" command, but if you get the
error "We don't know where your gerrit is." do the following:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
git remote add gerrit ssh://<username>@git.opendaylight.org:29418/controller.git
# Verify new remote URL
git remote -v
# gerrit  ssh://<username>@git.opendaylight.org:29418/controller.git (fetch)
# gerrit  ssh://<username>@git.opendaylight.org:29418/controller.git (push)
git review -s
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another issue might be the *user email and name*. In case the local
commit was made with incorrect configuration. Before the local commit
can be pushed into gerrit, configuration and commit must be fixed:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# change user name/email in global git config
git config --global user.name "Firstname Surname"
git config --global user.email "your.email@mailserver.com" 

# change user/email in local commit
git commit --amend --author="Firstname Surname <your.email@mailserver.com>" 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[seeing-your-change-in-gerrit]]
=== Seeing your change in Gerrit

Follow the link you got above to see your commit in Gerrit:

image:Gerrit Code Review.jpg[Gerrit Code Review.jpg,title="Gerrit Code Review.jpg"]

Note the Jenkins Controller User has verified your code, and at the
bottom is a link to the Jenkins build.

Once your code has been reviewed and submitted by a committer it will be
merged into the authoritative repo, which would look like this:

[[amending-your-commit]]
=== Amending your Commit

If you wish to 'amend' your commit and push a new PatchSet to your
existing Gerrit, you can make your changes, add them, and run:

------------------
git commit --amend
git review
