These instructions should enable you to use the CLI to pull and push to
the git repository, but hack on code from Eclipse.

[[introduction]]
== Introduction

Eclipse is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) which provides a
single pane of glass for developing and debugging source code. At
present only the following projects have been validated to import into
Eclipse without compile errors:

* Controller
* OpenflowPlugin

The remaining projects have not yet been modified to play nice with
Eclipse.

[[quick-start-useful-tips]]
==== Quick Start / Useful Tips

* Ctrl + Shift + T opens a window that allows you to search for any java
class.
* Ctrl + Shift + R opens a window that allows you to search for any
resource.
* Window->Preferences provides a large number of customization options
including use spaces for tabs, line numbers, etc. (On Mac it is
Eclipse->Preferences).

[[installing-eclipse]]
== Installing Eclipse

WARNING: If you use Ubuntu, see
link:Installing Eclipse on Ubuntu[Installing Eclipse on Ubuntu]. If you
try to install eclipse manually (as stated in these instructions) you
may end up in a situation in which it seens to not work or to work
erratically. For example the menu may fail to integrate with Ubuntu's
window manager properly.

1.  Make sure you have a Java 1.7 JDK installed.
2.  Download the Eclipse package ("for Java EE Developers", "for Java
Developers" and "for RCP and RAP Developers" all seem to work) and
extract it into your home directory.
3.  Increase the memory for the Eclipse installation by modifying the
http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse.ini[eclipse.ini] file in the same
directory as the eclipse executable.
* Change the -Xmx setting to be AT least 1G, recommended 2GB. (i.e.
-Xmx2048m ). _Note: This file may be in a different location depending
on your OS. Refer to http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse.ini[eclipse
documentation] if you don't see the file._
* Also change the PermGen space (-XX:MaxPermSize) to be at most 512MB,
i.e., -XX:MaxPermSize=512m. If you are only using 1 GB for max memory,
then I would suggest 300 MB to start for PermSize.
4.  (not required if you use Eclipse Luna) Install Eclipse Maven
Integration
1.  From Eclipse, go to Help => Install New Software...
2.  Paste "http://download.eclipse.org/technology/m2e/releases" into the
"Work with:" field
3.  Select m2e and (optionally) m2e - slf4j both _(1.4.0 is current as
of the writing of these instructions)_
4.  Click Next, OK and Finish else until things install
5.  Restart Eclipse when it asks
5.  Install Eclipse Xtend plugin
1.  From Eclipse, go to Help => Install New Software...
2.  Paste
"http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/tmf/xtext/updates/composite/releases"
into the "Work with:" field
3.  Uncheck "Show only the latest versions of available software" and
"Group items by category", if necessary.
4.  Select Xtend SDK 2.4.3.XXX and Xtend M2E extensions 2.4.3.XXX +
_There are newer versions, however our source currently uses version
2.4.3. Choosing a newer version will cause compile errors._
5.  Click Next, OK and Finish else until things install
6.  Restart Eclipse when it asks
6.  Install Eclipse Tycho integration
1.  From Eclipse, go to Help => Install New Software...
2.  Paste
http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/.m2e/connectors/m2eclipse-tycho/0.7.0/N/0.7.0.201309291400/
into the "Work with:" field.
3.  Select the Tycho Project Configurators. Click Next, OK, Finish etc
until it installs (ignore the unsigned content warning by clicking "OK"
in the form).
4.  Restart Eclipse when it asks.
7.  Install the build-helper-maven plugin (this allows eclipse to see
yang/xtend generated directories as source folders)
1.  From Eclipse, go to Windows => Preferences, expand the Maven folder
and select Discovery.
2.  In the right panel, click 'Open Catalog'.
3.  Type 'build' in he Find box to filter the list.
4.  You should see 'buildhelper' listed. Select it and click Finish.
5.  Click Next in the following 2 panels, accept the license terms and
click Finish (ignore the unsigned content warning by clicking "OK" in
the form).
6.  Restart Eclipse when it asks.
8.  Install Groovy plugin
1.  From Eclipse, go to Help => About, and note what eclipse version you
have (4,4, 4.3, 4.2 etc).
2.  From Eclipse, go to Help => Install New Software...
3.  In the "Work with:" field, paste
http://dist.springsource.org/release/GRECLIPSE/e4.4 and hit Enter. Note:
if you have an earlier eclipse version, change 4.4 to that version, e.g
http://dist.springsource.org/release/GRECLIPSE/e4.3 for version 4.3
4.  Select 'Groovy-Eclipse' and 'm2e Confgurator for Groovy-Eclipse' to
install.
5.  Click Next, accept the license terms and click Finish.
6.  Restart Eclipse when it asks.

[[automatically-avoiding-trailing-whitespace]]
=== Automatically Avoiding Trailing Whitespace

OpenDaylight (at least in the controller project) will refuse to compile
code which has trailing whitespaces in in. Eclipse can be configured to
automatically eliminate them for Java files.

1.  Go to Window => Preferences, expand Java => Editor and click "Save
Actions"
2.  check "Perform the selected actions on save" and "Additional
actions", but uncheck the rest
3.  click "Configure..." next to the additional actions (expand the
form's window if you don't see the button).
4.  Check "Remove trailing whitespace" and "All lines" on the first tab
("Code Organizing"), uncheck everything else on the other tabs (at the
bottom of the form you should see "1 of 27 save actions activated"; the
"1" in the message is important, the "27" can differ if not in version
4.4).

[[eclipse-maven-integration-m2e-version]]
=== Eclipse Maven Integration (m2e) version

Previously, there were issues with m2e 1.3 and we recommended using 1.2,
but those issues have been fixed and everything should works as expected
with the most recent m2e version, 1.4.

[[importing-the-source-into-eclipse]]
== Importing the Source Into Eclipse

1.  Pull the code from the command line and build it with these
OpenDaylight Controller:Pulling, Hacking, and Pushing the Code from the CLI[instructions].
The short version is:
1.  Pull the code:
`git clone ssh://<username>@git.opendaylight.org:29418/controller.git`
2.  Build the code:
`cd controller && MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx2048m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m" mvn clean install`
_You can also build from opendaylight/distribution/opendaylight, but it
just builds the distribution as opposed to building everything_ +
The long version is available here
GettingStarted:Pulling,_Hacking,_and_Pushing_All_the_Code_from_the_CLI.
3.  Incase you face issues with Non-Resolvable POM Parent Error while
compiling, you can check whether you have settings.xml properly
configured as mentioned in below link (See Edit ~/ml2/settings.xml
section)

https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/GettingStarted:Development_Environment_Setup#Edit_your_.7E.2F.m2.2Fsettings.xml

1.  Import all of the OpenDaylight projects into eclipse
1.  From Eclipse, go to File => Import => Maven => Existing Maven
Projects
2.  Browse to the root directory of the git repository
3.  All of the projects should be selected by default, just click Finish
4.  It may ask you to install Tycho, do so if it asks _(This should be a
1 time deal. Make sure you have enough memory allocated otherwise it can
cause Eclipse to hang and eventually crash)_
5.  It may also complain about jacoco, you should be able to ignore
those errors

[[help---i-still-have-red-xs-i.e.-eclipse-compile-errors]]
== Help - I still have Red X's! (i.e. Eclipse compile errors)

Eclipse is no longer able to compile OpenDayLight. The reason is three
maven plugins which are used by OpenDayLight but are not integrated into
Eclipse: maven-plugin-plugin, karaf-maven-plugin and
maven-antrun-plugin. This means you will always have Eclipse compile
errors in the project (this could go to up to 100000 errors).

You can use Eclipse for editing easily but to compile the project you
need to open a terminal window and do the compilation according to the
instructions from
OpenDaylight Controller:Pulling, Hacking, and Pushing the Code from the CLI[OpenDaylight
Controller:Pulling, Hacking, and Pushing the Code from the CLI] or
GettingStarted:Pulling, Hacking, and Pushing All the Code from the CLI[GettingStarted:Pulling,
Hacking, and Pushing All the Code from the CLI]. If you want to debug
the code, you need to do it remotely as described in the next section.

[[debugging-the-controller]]
== Debugging the Controller

As it is no longer possible to build OpenDayLight cleanly in Eclipse,
the only way to debug it is to use remote debugging. If you attempt to
run or debug OpenDayLight from Eclipse, you will end up with a build
failure reporting over 100000 errors and most likely run out of memory
as well.

[[attaching-the-debugger-to-a-running-odl]]
=== Attaching the Debugger to a Running ODL

Using Eclipse you can debug a locally running, or a remote running
controller. Thankfully, the way you do either debugging is the same.
First you start ODL with a debug flag, and then you tell Eclipse to
attach to the running application via IP. If it is a local instance, use
localhost, otherwise provide the hostname or IP address of the remote
server! +
 +
To remotely debug the controller you first need to start ODL with the
*-debug* flag, or just *debug* since Helium release.

1.  Start the controller with the -debug flag passed to the run.sh
script.
+
------------------
./run.sh -debug   
------------------
+
_This starts the controller, opening up port 8000 for debugging._ +
Since Helium, start the controller with the debug flag passed to the
karaf.sh script.
+
-----------------
./karaf.sh debug 
-----------------
+
_This starts the controller, opening up port 5005 for debugging._
2.  In Eclipse choose Run->"Debug Configurations"
* Under "Remote Java Application" choose a standard connection type, and
enter the hostname (localhost or remote controller name) and port (8000
by default).
* Under the "Source" tab click "Add" and then "Java Project". This will
give you a list of all java projects in the workspace. Select them all
and click OK a few times to close out of the dialogs. +
_Note: this should only be required once per debug configuration._
* Click debug to launch the debugger.

[[debugging-a-start-up-issue]]
=== Debugging a Start Up Issue

Sometimes it is necessary to debug an issue that only occurs at
start-up. If thats the case, the above technique can be frustrating
because it becomes a race condition between you and the start up
process! Thankfully there is a way you can start ODL, but pause any
initialization code until a debugger is attached! To do this, start ODL
using the *-debugsuspend* flag. `
 ./run.sh -debugsuspend
` ''This starts the controller, but pauses before any initialization
code is run. Additionally it opens port 8000 for debugging. In order for
ODL to start up now you MUST connect a debugger remotely, using the same
process defined above.

[[debugging-weird-errors]]
== Debugging Weird Errors

If Eclipse starts giving you lots of weird errors that seem to make no
sense, try the following things:

1.  right click on the project with the issue and go to Maven => Update
Project... and then press OK
* You can do this more easily by creating a single "Java Working Set"
for all of the OpenDaylight projects
* Do that by going File => New => Java Working Set and giving it a name
and adding all the projects you want
* When you're importing Maven projects into Eclipse, you can also check
the "Add project(s) to working set" box at the bottom of the dialog and
pick the working set you're using for OpenDaylight
* Then you can right-click on the project and do the Maven = Update
Project... on all of them at once
2.  If that doesn't work closing, deleting and the reimporting all of
the OpenDaylight projects seems to help when nothing else does
* while you have the projects not imported into Eclipse, it doesn't hurt
to do a build from the CLI as well

[[frequent-gotchas]]
=== Frequent gotchas

* eclipse needs to setup a classpath variable M2_REPO pointing to local
repository. Can be done manually or via
+
::
  `mvn -Declipse.workspace=<path-to-eclipse-workspace> eclipse:add-maven-repo`
* some projects miss maven-compiler-plugin configuration and render into
java 1.4 compliant settings - you need to change that manually in
eclipse or fix corresponding pom
* when running eclipse:eclipse upon parent pom which aggregates modules,
then in eclipse these modules will "see" each other in workspace. If you
change code on project A, eclipse will recompile it and new stuff is
immediately available to project B (having the same parent). Anyway
workspace dependencies in eclipse can be set or removed manually
anytime.
* when running eclipse:eclipse upon bottom project pom, where no modules
resides, eclipse will see it after import as independent project having
all dependencies pointed to local repo
* when using pax-exam you need to install touched artifacts into local
repo in order for pax-exam to put updated version on classpath
* by default maven updates every SNAPSHOT dependency every 24 hours, so
if you need stable environment do not forget to use *-nsu* switch

[[advantages]]
=== Advantages

* if you want to freeze all SNAPSHOT dependencies, use *-nsu* (no
snapshot update) switch or *-o* (offline)
* if you want to update all SNAPSHOT dependencies, use *-U* switch
* if you want to build only a subset of projects contained in parent
pom, use this (maven will take care of build order)
+
::
  `mvn clean install -pl <relative_path_to_subproject1>,<relative_path_to_subproject2>..`
* if you want to continue a failed build (after fixing it) when having
many modules, use this
+
::
  `mvn clean install -rf <relative_path_to_broken_broject>`
* you can apply remote debug on everything you have source code of
(including plugins), just use *mvnDebug*
* to run test from commandline use
+
::
  `mvn test`
  +
  `mvn test -Dtest=<testName_without_package>`
  +
  `mvn test -Dtest=<testName_without_package>#<methodName>`
* if everything fails, use -X to see TRACE output

And as all these are shell commands, you are free to chain them (with ;
|| && &) and automate your work a bit:

`mvn clean compile -DskipTests && cd target/longPathToDistribution; aplay `` > /dev/null & ./run.bat -debug; cd -`

[[alternative-way-without-m2eclipse-plugin---for-cli-fans]]
== Alternative way without m2eclipse plugin - for CLI-fans

Sometimes m2eclipse plugin does weird things like compiling in infinite
loop, updating dependencies when they need to be frozen and the other
way around. If you want to omit m2eclipse plugin completely, you can. Of
course the xtend plugin is still needed.

1.  pull code from git
2.  run in folder with pom:
+
::
  `mvn eclipse:eclipse -DdownloadSources=true`
3.  start eclipse and import _existing project_ (navigate to folder with
pom)

[[import-ordering]]
== Import ordering

Configure import ordering to avoid noise when doing code review. Open
Preferences (Window/Preferences), then Java/Code Style/Organize Imports.
Remove all rules and add following rule:

`* - all unmatched type imports.`

This should organize imports in following way:

1.  static imports sorted alphabetically
2. 
3.  imports sorted alphabetically

See following screenshot:
image:Eclipse-imports.png[Eclipse-imports.png,title="fig:Eclipse-imports.png"]
