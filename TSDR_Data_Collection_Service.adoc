== Design Overview

TSDR Data Collection Service collects time series data in ODL
Controller. It does that by launching and controlling the configured
Data Collectors for each source of the data. Data Collector based on
their respective configuration, collect the data and use Data Collection
Service to persist the data. The Data Collection Service internally
utilizes
link:TSDR Data Storage Service and Persistence with HBase Plugin[TSDR
Data Storage Service] to do the actual persistence of time series data.
The TSDR Data Collection Service controls the lifecycle of the Data
Collectors.

The main modules of TSDR Data Collection Service

* TSDR Data Collection Service - config subsystem initialized YANG based
service integrating with MD-SAL services
* TSDR Data Collector(s) - Data Collection implementing the defined
DataCollector interface
* TSDR Data Collection Service Writer - writer object registered with
Data Collector(s) that help in communicating back to TSDR Data
Collection Service for data writes

[[design-considerationgoals]]
== Design Consideration/Goals

* Addition of new Data Collectors must be possible and should be easily
integrated with collection service
* Apart from Lifecycle management by Data Collection Service, the Data
Collectors are independent of how they collect data
* TSDR Data Collection should be optional to the overall functionality
of the Controller and by default not turned on
* Data Collectors are abstracted from the interaction of Data Collection
Service with TSDR Data Storage Service
* Data Collectors should not impact the performance of the data source
while collecting TSDR
* Data Collectors should recover from data source failure

[[data-collection-service]]
=== Data Collection Service

* Acts like a container for all the DataCollectors
* Reads the configuration to determine the DataCollectors to instantiate
* Instantiates the DataCollectors , passing their respective
configuration
* Registers the Writer with DataCollectors so that DataCollectors can
use it when they need to write the data
* DataCollectors will work in parallel without dependency on one another
* Interacts with Data Storage Service for actual persistence
* Provides Data Collectors with the needed MD-SAL service like
notification service

[[data-collectors]]
=== Data Collectors

Data Collectors can be currently classified into 2 types

`a) Data Collectors that act on Notification from Controller stores (OFStats fall into this group) ` +
`b) Data Collectors that poll data (e.g. SNMP data collector) ` +

Note : For Lithium we are implementing a) and if time permits PoC b)to
validate more than one data collector

In general all DataCollector have the following behavior

* Implements the DataCollector interface of TSDR Data Collection Service
* Parses the config passed by TSDR Data Collection Service to determine
what data needs to be collected & from where. Note this configuration
piece is very DataCollector specific and the DataCollector is the only
one interpreting the same
* Honors the start and stop request from TSDR Data Collection Service in
efficient manner
* DataCollector handles the data source failure recovery mechanism (if
applicable)
* Utilizes TSDR Data Collection Service registered
DataCollectionServiceWriter to write the collected TSDR data

[[datacollectionservicewriter]]
=== DataCollectionServiceWriter

For each DataCollector, the DataCollectionService registers a
DataCollectionServiceWriter during initialization before the start of
data collection. DataCollectionServiceWriter supports write(Mapdata)
i..e taking a map wherein key uniquely identifies the metric being
collected for the DataCollector and value is the Metric Value.

=== TSDR Data Collection Service Config

The following shows the config for TSDR DataCollection Service. Note
this initial config and is subject to change based on discovering more
items that needs to be included.
