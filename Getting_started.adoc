=== *Getting started with OpenDaylight*

(Open SDN) — the use of standards-based protocols and open interfaces to
abstract the network control plane from the data plane. Open SDN enables
unified control and programmability across a network of heterogeneous
physical and virtual devices. The Open SDN architecture is built around
the controller, which provides a common data model and policy
abstraction for all the network fabric elements
