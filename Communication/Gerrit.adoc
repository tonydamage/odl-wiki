== Recieving mail from Gerrit

To receieve mail directly from https://git.opendaylight.org/[Gerrit] you
must have registered an account with our
https://identity.opendaylight.org[identity] system first. Then the first
time you login to Gerrit it will acquire your primary email address from
the identity system. You may add additional email addresses to the
system by using the *Register New Email* link in your Gerrit user
settings. You may then set an alternate email address as your preferred
contact address instead of your primary from the drop down next to the
button.

== Getting Gerrit mail for projects that do not have a dedicated mailing
list

For projects that do not have dedicated -gerrit@lists.opendaylight.org
mailing lists the only way to get notice mail of changes is to setup
project watches. This is a very powerful system that allows you to get
mail on just the topics you actually care about, be they entire projects
or just branches of projects.

Setting up a project watch is done in the following way:

In your personal settings for Gerrit select *Watched Projects*
(highlight 1)

Enter the project you wish to monitor in the *Project Name* box
(highlight 2)

If you have any specific sub searches enter then *Only if* box
(highlight 3) NOTE: all standard
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/Documentation/user-search.html[Gerrit
searches] can be used for the *Only if*

Press *Watch* (highlight 4)

Once the project has been added to your list you may select the options
that you want to get mail for.

NOTE: Completely contrived setup for project watches to highlight how
they can be used

In the case of this screen shot the integration project is watched for
everything except Abandoned Changes (hightlight 5). Additionally the
ovsdb project is watching the stable/hydrogen branch but only for
Abandoned Changes (hightlight 6).

That's all there is to it. If you want to stop getting mail from a
specific project all you need to do is check the box next to the project
name and press the *Delete* button.

== Configuring Gerrit to watch all projects

If you desire to subscribe to all projects then for the *Project Name*
use the special *All-Projects* group.
