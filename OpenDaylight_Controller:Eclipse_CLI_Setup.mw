==Starting From Scratch==

# Pull the code from the command line ([[OpenDaylight Controller:Pulling, Hacking, and Pushing the Code from the CLI|Instructions]])
# Download and install Eclipse ("for Java EE Developers", "for Java Developers" and "for RCP and RAP Developers" all seem to work)
# Install Eclipse Maven Integration Version 1.2.0
## From Eclipse, go to Help => Install New Software...
## Paste "http://download.eclipse.org/technology/m2e/releases" into the "Work with:" field
## Uncheck the "Show only the latest versions of available software box"
## Select m2e and (optionally) m2e - slf4j both with version 1.2.0.whatever
## Click Next, OK and Finish else until things install
# Restart Eclipse when it asks
# Import all of the OpenDaylight projects
## From Eclipse, go to File => Import => Maven => Existing Maven Projects
## Browse to the opendaylight/distributions/opendaylight directory in the git repository
## All of the projects should be selected by default, just click Finish
## It may ask you to install Tycho, do so if it asks

==If you Installed a Newer Version of m2e==

# Close and then delete all of the current OpenDaylight projects in Eclipse so that you can reimport them later
# Uninstall m2e
## go to About Eclipse -> Installation Details -> Select the m2e packages -> Click uninstall
## For me, there were 2 m2e packages: "m2e - Maven Integration for Eclipse" and "m2e - slf4j over logback logging (Optional)"
# Restart Eclipse when it asks
# Pick up with the steps above starting with installing Eclipse Maven Integration 1.2.0
