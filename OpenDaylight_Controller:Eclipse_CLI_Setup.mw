These instructions should enable you to use the CLI to pull and push to the git repository, but hack on code from Eclipse.

==Starting From Scratch==

# Pull the code from the command line and build it with these [[OpenDaylight Controller:Pulling, Hacking, and Pushing the Code from the CLI|instructions]]. The short version is:
## Pull the code: <tt>git clone ssh://<username>@git.opendaylight.org:29418/controller.git</tt>
## Build the code: <tt>cd controller && mvn clean install</tt> ''You can also build from opendaylight/distribution/opendaylight, but it just builds the distribution as opposed to building everything''
# Download and install Eclipse ("for Java EE Developers", "for Java Developers" and "for RCP and RAP Developers" all seem to work)
# Install Eclipse Maven Integration
## From Eclipse, go to Help => Install New Software...
## Paste "http://download.eclipse.org/technology/m2e/releases" into the "Work with:" field
## Select m2e and (optionally) m2e - slf4j both ''(1.4.0 is current as of the writing of these instructions)''
## Click Next, OK and Finish else until things install
# Restart Eclipse when it asks
# Install Eclipse Xtend plugin
## From Eclipse, go to Help => Install New Software...
## Paste "http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/tmf/xtext/updates/composite/releases" into the "Work with:" field
## Select Xtend SDK and Xtend M2E extensions under Xtend-2.4.3 ''(2.4.3 is the most recent version as of the writing of these instructions)''
## Click Next, OK and Finish else until things install
# Restart Eclipse when it asks
# Import all of the OpenDaylight projects
## From Eclipse, go to File => Import => Maven => Existing Maven Projects
## Browse to the root directory of the git repository
## All of the projects should be selected by default, just click Finish
## It may ask you to install Tycho, do so if it asks

==Eclipse Maven Integration (m2e) version==

Previously, there were issues with m2e 1.3 and we recommended using 1.2, but those issues have been fixed and everything should works as expected with the most recent m2e version, 1.4.

==Debugging Weird Errors==

If Eclipse starts giving you lots of weird errors that seem to not make sense, closing, deleting and reimporting all of the OpenDaylight projects seems to help pretty frequently.
