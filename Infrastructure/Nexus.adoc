https://nexus.opendaylight.org[Nexus] along with
OpenDaylight_Controller:Gerrit_Setup[Gerrit] and
GettingStarted:Project_Main[Jenkins] is at the heart of our continous
integration. As we are using some of the advanced features of Nexus the
edition in use by The Linux Foundation for OpenDaylight is the
Professional edition. That does not, however, mean that you can't setup
your own local Nexus proxy to help speed up your own builds or the
builds for developers on your local network if you're wanting to do this
inside your corporate network. If you're just setting up a proxy the
http://www.sonatype.org/nexus/[OSS edition] of Nexus will be all you
really need. If you happen to have a license for the professional
edition, the details listed here will still be applicable.

To setup a simple proxy to handle your OpenDaylight builds first install
and start Nexus. See the
http://books.sonatype.com/nexus-book/reference/_installing_nexus.html[Sonatype
documentation] on how to actually install and setup Nexus.

Now that you've got your system up and running and have hopefully logged
into it for the first time it's time to get the repositories configured.
The rest of this documention will be using the assumption that this is a
dedicated proxy for OpenDaylight. If you are adding repositories to an
existing Nexus system to support building OpenDaylight please talk with
your administrator about adding just what is needed from the following
information.

The cleanest way to do all of this is to first open the repositories tab
and and then remove all existing repositories. We'll be adding a couple
back in but it's cleaner if everything matches.

Cleared|600px,title="All Repositories Cleared|600px"]

Now that you've cleared out the repositories we'll start adding in all
the repositories that are needed for cleanly building OpenDaylight. All
repositories added will be added as Proxy Repositories

Let's start with the Maven Central repostory.

Select 'Add...' -> 'Proxy Repository'

image:Nexus Add Proxy Repository.png[Nexus Add Proxy Repository.png,title="Nexus Add Proxy Repository.png"]

You will need to fill in the following information:

*Repository ID:* central +
*Repository Name:* central +
*Remote Storage Location:* https://secure.central.sonatype.com/maven2/

Select the 'Save' button as all the rest of the options will be left at
their defaults.

Now that we've done one repository here is the information for all the
repositories for which you can just take the defaults with the
appropriate variables set.

There is one more repository that you will want to mirror. This one
needs a few extra variables set in the configuration.

*Repository ID:* opendaylight.snapshot +
*Repository Name:* opendaylight.snapshot +
*Repository Policy:* Snapshot +
*Remote Storage Location:*
https://nexus.opendaylight.org/content/repositories/opendaylight.snapshot/
*Not Found Cache TTL:* 1 (*NOTE:* We have a few proxies on the same
network as the master Nexus one so having a short negative TTL doesn't
hurt much here. You can try adjusting this to higher values to help
improve any negative caching misses) +
*Metadata Max Age:* 5

Now that you've configured all of the repository proxies it's time to
update the *Public Repositories* meta group.

Select the *Public Repositories* group from the repository list and if
it is not currently on the *Configuration* tab switch to it.

You will want to press the |< button to move all of the *Available
Repositories* into the *Ordered Group Repositories* box. After you have
done that select *opendaylight.snapshot* from the list and press the >
button to move that back to the *Available Repsositories* section and
press *Save*

The final step in utilizing this local proxy is modifying your personal
(or build system's) .m2/settings.xml file to see it as a mirror. The
following basic settings.xml file should be modified and placed in the
proper place to make this work for your environment

code,xml--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
code,xml
<settings>
  <mirrors>
    <mirror>
      <id>opendaylight-release-mirror</id>
      <name>Local Nexus mirror for OpenDaylight builds</name>
      <url>http://[YOUR_SYSTEM_FQDN][:PORT_IF_NEEDED][/BASE_URI_FRAGMENT]/content/groups/public/</url>
      <mirrorOf>*,!opendaylight-snapshot,!opendaylight.snapshot</mirrorOf>
    </mirror>
    <mirror>
      <id>opendaylight-snapshot-mirror</id>
      <name>Local Nexus mirror for OpenDaylight snapshots</name>
      <url>http://[YOUR_SYSTEM_FQDN][:PORT_IF_NEEDED][/BASE_URI_FRAGMENT]/content/repositories/opendaylight.snapshot</url>
      <mirrorOf>opendaylight-snapshot,opendaylight.snapshot</mirrorOf>
    </mirror>
  </mirrors>
</settings>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A couple of example URLs are as follows:

http://nexus.example.com:8080/nexus/content/groups/public

http://nexus.example.com/content/groups/public

The difference is in the port and base URI fragment but that should help
get you started.
