Gerrit provides a framework for reviewing commits before they are accepted into the code base. Changes can be uploaded to Gerrit but are not made a part of the project until the changes been reviewed and accepted. Gerrit is also a good collaboration tool for storing the conversations that occur around the commits. 

Log into Gerrit at https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/
This link works best in Firefox or Chrome. 

Due to the current locked down state, you must log in to Gerrit to get any useful information, and you can only get the code after you have registered an ssh key.

When you log in you will see a very boring screen (shown below) and need to click '''SignIn'''

[[File:Gerrit Setup Initial.jpg|570px]]

Which will prompt you to sign in.  Please use the same credentials you have to log in for other OpenDaylight purposes.  If you need additional purposes to have accounts, please email [mailto:helpdesk@opendaylight.org helpdesk@opendaylight.org]
You can see below the login prompt:

Once signed in you will be able to see existing Gerrit requests, patches that folks have pushed that have not yet been verified, reviewed, and merged into the authoritative repo.  Your next setup step should be to set up an SSH key.
For the less visually oriented, there is [http://gerrit.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/2.0/user-upload.html Gerrit has excellent documentation]... but visual are shown below:

Then click '''SSH Public Keys''' as shown below

[[File:Gerrit Setup Settings.jpg|570px]]

And enter your ssh key.  If you do not have an ssh key, there are wonderful [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys Instructions for generating an ssh key] and if you have one you can get it using

 '''cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub''' 

Once you've pasted your SSH key, click ""Add""

[[File:Gerrit Setup Add SSH Key.jpg|570px]]

and you will see it as shown below:

To verify your SSH key is working correctly, try using an SSH client to connect to Gerrit's SSHD port. 

 $ '''ssh -p 29418''''' <sshusername>'''''@git.opendaylight.org'''
 Enter passphrase for key '/home/cisco/.ssh/id_rsa':

You can now proceed to either [[OpenDaylight Controller:Pulling, Hacking, and Pushing the Code from the CLI|Pulling, Hacking, and Pushing the Code from the CLI]] or [[OpenDaylight Controller:Pulling, Hacking, and Pushing the Code from Eclipse|Pulling, Hacking, and Pushing the Code from Eclipse]], depending on your implementation.
