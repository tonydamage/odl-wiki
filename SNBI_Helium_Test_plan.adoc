== Manual Testing Plan for SNBI Registrar

[[initial-configuration]]
=== Initial Configuration

Testing with the following configurations on karaf with RC2. +
feature:install odl-snbi-all +
feature:install odl-restconf +
feature:install odl-mdsal-apidocs +
=== YANG MD-SAL operations === Refer

for the yang definition.

* Addition of domain information. [Passed]
* Enable/Disable a domain White list. [Passed]
* Removal of Domain information. [passed]
* Removal of a list in the domain. [passed]
* Removal of a device from the list of a domain. [passed]
* Add multiple lists to the same domain. [Passed]
* Have multiple active lists to the same domain. [Passed]
* Support for multiple domains in the controller, to be able to spawn
per domain registrars. [Failed] [Lithium] [bug 2044]

[[neighbor-discovery]]
=== Neighbor Discovery

* Discover a neighbor connected directly on the LAN. [passed]
* Discover multiple neighbors connected directly to a given LAN.
[passed]
* Remove the neighbor information once the neighbor is lost. [passed]
* Rediscover the neighbor once the neighbor lost is brought online.
[passed]
* Certificate exchange with a neighbor device, without bootstrapping the
device. [passed]
* Certificate exchange with a neighbor device after bootstrapping both
the controller and the forwarding element. [passed]
* Certificate exchange with invalid Certificate or CSR information.
[failed] [bug 2050]

[[bootstrap-of-devices]]
=== BootStrap of devices

* Bootstrap a device with no domain information from the MD-SAL.
[passed]
* Bootstrap multiple devices in multiple white list of the same domain.
[passed]
* Bootstrap a neighbor once the neighbor is lost and brought online.
[failed] [bug 2053]
* Bootstrap a device when the domain information is present but the
device list is not yet active. [passed]
* Activate the device list thru RESTConf and verify the bootstrap of the
device. [passed]
* Bootstrap of a device which is not in the white list. [passed]
* Bootstrap a device with multiple active white list within the same
domain. [passed]
* Bootstrap a device and then remove the device from the white list,
this should take the device out of the domain and revoke the
certificate. [Failed] [Lithium] [Out of scope for Helium].We cannot
support dynamic updates to the MD-SAL because that would require that
certificates be revoked, if the list is updated.
* Bootstrap request for an invalidated device should be ignored.
[passed]
