=Fixes=
* Do proper MarK & Sweep state sync between controller & switch on switch reconnect
* Urgent: Fix adapters to not have race condition
* Check for and sort out any lingering OF10 issues in OFplugin
* Spread out stats polling
* Revisit & cleanup the OF yang models


= New Features=
* Migrate the OF Plugin onto the Configuration Subsystem
** Implement changes to allow extensibility in OF Library and OF Plugin (registers, ...)
* Plugin internal stats - add more, make stats accessible through the config subsystem
* Handle reserve ports as actual named things (and fix adapters around that) (note: OF10 and OF13 have different port numbers for the same logical reserve ports... adapters should also be fixed to handle)
* Make topology initially aggressive then very calm
* Revisit the FRM architecture:
** May need multiple priorities for handling of different message types (e.g. topology discovery & port up/down should have the higher priority than ARP or pkt in)

=Testing=
* Implement regression testing during Jenkins builds ('integration testing VM for the OF plugin')
* Performance & scale testing:
** Mininet & cbench
** Real hardware topologies
