=Fixes=
* Do proper MarK & Sweep state sync between controller & switch on switch reconnect
* Urgent: Fix adapters to not have race condition
* Check for and sort out any lingering OF10 issues in OFplugin
* Stats Collection:
** Spread out stats polling throughout the stats collection interval
** Only start stats collection after the previous collection of the stat has finished (i.e. do not be timer-driven)
* Revisit & cleanup the OF yang models

= New Features=
* Migrate the OF Plugin onto the Configuration Subsystem
** Implement changes to allow extensibility in OF Library and OF Plugin (registers, ...)
* Plugin internal stats - add more, make stats accessible through the config subsystem
* Handle reserve ports as actual named things (and fix adapters around that) (note: OF10 and OF13 have different port numbers for the same logical reserve ports... adapters should also be fixed to handle)
* Make topology initially aggressive then very calm
* [[penDaylight_OpenFlow_Plugin:Backlog:Threading Model and Packet Handling Priority|Threading Model and Packet Handling Priority]]
* TLS support

* Port config.
* Queue config.
* DTLS based connection establishment not supported.
* Role request not supported.

* [[OpenDaylight_OpenFlow_Plugin:Backlog:Overload Protection and Event Dampening|Overload Protection and Event Dampening]]

=Testing=
* Implement regression testing during Jenkins builds ('integration testing VM for the OF plugin')
* Performance & scale testing:
** Mininet & cbench
** Real hardware topologies
* Convert existing python regression tests to roboto framework and make it part of integration project and their automated testing framework.
