* [[OpenDaylight OpenFlow Plugin:Backlog:Statistics collection performance improvements|Statistics collection performance improvements]]
* Revisit & cleanup the OF yang models

= New Features=
* Migrate the OF Plugin onto the Configuration Subsystem
** Implement changes to allow extensibility in OF Library and OF Plugin (registers, ...)
* Plugin internal stats - add more, make stats accessible through the config subsystem
* Handle reserve ports as actual named things (and fix adapters around that) (note: OF10 and OF13 have different port numbers for the same logical reserve ports... adapters should also be fixed to handle)

=Testing=
* Implement regression testing during Jenkins builds ('integration testing VM for the OF plugin')
* Performance & scale testing:
** Mininet & cbench
** Real hardware topologies
* Convert existing python regression tests to roboto framework and make it part of integration project and their automated testing framework.
