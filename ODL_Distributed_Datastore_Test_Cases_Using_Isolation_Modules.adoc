[[testbed-setup-instructions]]
== Testbed Setup Instructions:

[[software-installation]]
=== Software Installation:

* Download or build a base distribution of the controller 1
* Though these instructions will work with any distribution to test
--you must use the openflowplugin 1.3 --use a distribution where the new
openflowplugin is the default or where it can be turned on.
* The easiest approach is to use OpenflowPlugin distribution.
* Go to the distribution directory rename
configuration/initial/05-clustering.xml.conf to
configuration/initial/05-clustering.xml
* Run the controller with the following command ./run.sh
-XX:MaxPermSize=512m
* Perform the Test Case -- 1. Basic Test
* Once you have verified 1. Basic Test passes copy the binaries to
Controller 2, Controller 3

[[three-node-cluster-setup]]
==== Three Node Cluster Setup:

Follow the instructions of "Three Node Cluster setup" and "Three Node
Cluster with HA" -- to update the akka.conf and module-shards.conf that
can be found in link:Running and testing an OpenDaylight Cluster[Running
and testing OpenDaylight Cluster]

[[isolation-models]]
==== Isolation Models

Details of Isolation Models used to do functional HA test on Distributed
Datastore/Remote RPC can be found in
link:Running and testing an OpenDaylight Cluster[Running and testing
OpenDaylight Cluster]

[[isolation-test-driver---clustering-test-service]]
=== Isolation Test Driver - Clustering Test Service

* You need to build the sal-clustering-it-model-1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
sal-clustering-it-provider-1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar and copy them to each
controller plugins directory. These projects can be found in integration
repo under
'''integration/test/tools/odl-mdsal-clustering-tests/clustering-test-app
folder
* The Isolation Test Driver files can be found in integration repo under
*integration/test/tools/odl-mdsal-clustering-tests/clustering-functional-test*.These
are python based and utilizes requests library that you can download
from here http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/

[[jmx-url]]
=== JMX URL

To check leadership in the cluster, replicated journal log and commit
index you need to use the following JMX URL

http://:8080/controller/nb/v2/jolokia/read/org.opendaylight.controller:Category=Shard,name=member-1-shard-inventory-operational,type=DistributedDatastore
