== Description ==

Every OpenDaylight project is likely to need two kinds of starter maven projects:

# '''A parent pom project''' - to house the common 'parent' pom.xml file that is read in for common data like repositories and shared dependencies for other maven projects and to build all of the modules from one place
# '''A distribution directory''' - to allow each project to have a 'distribution' directory that rolls up its own local version of the controller for use in development, allowing the exclusion of or addition of modules

== Deliverables ==

# A 'starter' 'commons/parent' and 'distribution/' directories suitable for ODL projects to copy into the top level of their git repo
# A wiki page explaining how to do so and modify them for their project, including:
## Adding new modules to be built to the 'commons/parent/pom.xml'
## Including/excluding modules in the 'distribution/pom.xml'
## How to use both to build

== Pointers ==

We have some examples to start from in:

[https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/390/ Gerrit 390]
and the combination of 
[https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/784/ Gerrit 784] and [https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/785/ Gerrit 785].

== Notes: ==

# The commons/parent directory should *not* have the commons.opendaylight directory as it's parent pom (as it does in the examples for OVSDB Gerrits 784 and 785)
# Please feel free to push these directories into a directory 'starters/' in the controller project
# Please look into things like [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/160608/how-to-do-a-git-export-like-svn-export git archive] to provide instructions to folks on how to pull the freshest starter in a way that allows them to drop it cleanly into their own git repo.
