== MD-SAL

There are two types of code generation going on in MD-SAL.

1.  Java Interfaces and DTO generation from the YANG Models. These go
under target->generated-sources. This is well supported under IntelliJ
Idea. Not sure if there are issues in Eclipse.
2.  Xtend is used for template based code generation and also simply as
an alternative to java in some places. Xtend compiles into Java Source
Code. Xtend is well supported in Eclipse including direct debugging of
Xtend Code. IntelliJ does not have any support for Xtend. There are
plans limit the use of Xtend to code generation and eliminate all other
usage. There are Bugs in Bugzilla to track those.
* There is some evidence that while Eclipse _supports_ Xtend, it does
not actively find directories with generated sources after importing.
