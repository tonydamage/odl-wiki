== Global Service ==

* only one instance per controller instance

=== Routing ===

* Binding-Aware MD-SAL (sal-binding)
* '''Rpc Type''' - Identified by generated RpcService class and name of invoked method on that interface
* Binding-Independent MD-SAL (sal-dom)
* '''Rpc Type''' - Identified by QName

== Routed Service ==

* multiple instances (implementation) of service per controller instance
* usually used for southbound plugin

=== Routing ===

Routing is done based on the contents of message such as Node reference. Routing field in message is specified in YANG model by using routing-reference statement from yang-ext model.

<ul>
<li>Binding Aware MD-SAL (sal-binding)</li>
<li>'''Rpc Type''' - Identified by used RpcService subclass and name of invoked method on that interface</li>
<li><p>'''Instance Identifier''' - identifies instance of element in data tree which will be used as route target. The used class is:</p>
<pre>    org.opendaylight.yang.binding.InstanceIdentifier        </pre></li>
<li>Binding Independent MD-SAL (sal-dom)</li>
<li>'''Rpc Type''' - Identified by QName</li>
<li><p>'''Instance Identifier''' - identifies instance of element in data tree which will be used as route target. The used class is:</p>
<pre>    org.opendaylight.yang.data.api.InstanceIdentifier</pre></li>
</ul>


== Mounted Service ==

Mounted service is special type of services, which could be nested at well-known points in overall data tree. Mounted services are could be other implementations of Routed Services or Global services, but caller is requested to identify mounted service instance.

=== Routing ===

Routing is done based on the instance identifier, which is provided separately to the payload of message.

<ul>
<li>Binding Aware MD-SAL (sal-binding)</li>
<li>'''Rpc Type''' - Identified by used RpcService subclass and name of invoked method on that interface</li>
<li><p>'''Instance Identifier''' - identifies instance of element in data tree which will be used as route target. The used class is:</p>
<pre>    org.opendaylight.yang.binding.InstanceIdentifier        </pre></li>

<li>Binding Independent MD-SAL (sal-dom)</li>
<li>'''Rpc Type''' - Identified by QName</li>
<li><p>'''Instance Identifier''' - identifies instance of element in data tree which will be used as route target. The used class is:</p>
<pre>    org.opendaylight.yang.data.api.InstanceIdentifier</pre></li>
