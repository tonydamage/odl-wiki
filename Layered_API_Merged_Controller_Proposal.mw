I'd like to thank Colin and Dave for their proposal on Monday.  I've spent almost the entire time since then going in depth on the implications and trying to really understand the practical engineering reality of it.

Unfortunately, our investigation raised a large number of concerns about working on top of the SAL and I'm not sure that these things are easily resolvable.  I'm in the process of trying to document these concerns (some of them are raised in the linked power point), but it's not clear to us how we can move forward with an approach that involves a single API layer like the SAL.

Please read the attached proposal and send comments.
