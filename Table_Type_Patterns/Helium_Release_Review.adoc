== Architectural Issues

None of note.

[[security-considerations]]
== Security Considerations

As it is just a YANG model to-date, none of note.

[[quality-assurance-test-coverage-etc]]
== Quality Assurance (test coverage, etc)

The only Java code that is checked provides unit tests to test the
model. It covers every top-level member specified in the TTP spec, but
exact code coverage is not known since the coverage is actually of lines
of YANG not lines of Java.
