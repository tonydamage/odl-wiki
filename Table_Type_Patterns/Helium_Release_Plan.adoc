|Name |Description
|TTP codec |Ability to read/write TTPs to files/streams

|TTP Model |Ability to provide TTPs in a compatible manner with how the
Openflow_Protocol_Library:Main[OpenFlow library] models table features.

|TTP surfacing |Ability to surface the fact that a device currently
supports a given TTP in the MD-SAL DOM.

|TTP registry |Ability to host a set of named TTPs, browse their
capabilities, and select interest in them

|Name |Status |Description
|Release Plan |Done |Final Release Plan

|Pushing to Nexus |Done |Gerrit/Jenkins merge process successfully
pushes project binary artifacts to Nexus repo

|TTP codec |Mostly (expected M5) |Support for reading/writing JSON TTP
files +
_Mostly:_ A nearly complete YANG file is able to read and write JSON TTP
files with a format that is very close to the ONF spec. We are working
on a converter that will do the simple transform from ONF TTP JSON to
ODL TTP JSON.

|Name |Status |Description
|TTP registry |Mostly (expected M5) |Ability to host a set of named
TTPs, browse their capabilities, and select interest in them +
TTPs are mostly modeled and once they are, this is a trivial feature

|Started Integration Testing |Done |Integration test with yangtools,
controller, and openflowjava created.

|Started Documentation |Partial (expected M5) |Architectural and code
documentation exists, but we have yet to start on developer and user
documentation. User and Developer documentation may be sparse and mostly
be pointers to our Unit and Integration test code.

|Name |Status |Description
|API Freeze |Done (some additions until M5) |The only current API we
have is the TTP yang file which is mostly complete. We intend to leave
the currently defined sections as is and only add fields thus freezing
the current API. Other features of the API may come until M5.

|TTP Model |Mostly (expected M5) |This and the TTP codec above are now
one and the same.
