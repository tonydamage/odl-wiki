This page captures Muthu's work on the threading model and packat
handling priorities

= The Proposed Thread Model for the OF1.3 Plugin / OF NSFs

The propsoed model is shown in the following figure:

[[thread-pools]]
== Thread Pools

* *Socket I/O Threadpool*:
** Owned by : Netty I/O library
** Lifecycle managed by : OFLibrary
** Functionality :
*** Multiplexed socket I/O operations
*** Escalating events to execution thread pool
** Special Requirements : Should not perform complex operations which
can introduce latency and create head-of-line blocking for other
connections
** Configuration Management : Config subsystem (or simple ini file ?)

* *Execution Threadpool*:
** Owned by : Netty I/O library
** Lifecycle managed by : OFLibrary
** Functionality :
*** Executes entire business logic of OpenflowPlugin (including
priority-assignment, processing and notification-publishing to MD-SAL)
*** Ensures order of messages from Socket I/O thread pool on per socket
basis. But order need not be guaranteed across connections of same
switch
*** Packet classification to assign priorities (see slide 6 for details)
*** Assign configured priorities for each message from each
switch-connection (see slide 6 for details)
** Special Requirements :
*** All current business logic (handshake, translation, publishing
notifications) must be adapted to run in this thread pool
*** No internal queue must be maintained within this execution-context
(because Netty’s I/O threadpool to execution thread-pool by itself is a
transition via internal Netty’s queue)
** Configuration Management : Config subsystem (or simple ini file ?)

* *Notification Thread Pool (MD-SAL Core)*:
** Owned by : MD-SAL Core
** Lifecycle managed by : MD-SAL
** Functionality :
*** Executes internal MD-SAL functionality like – routing, data
operations etc
*** Dispatches messages based on session (switch) + priority combination
(see slide 6 for details)
*** NSFs’ notification-handling logic would also be executed in this
pool. Hence must be able to cope with the differences in processing
times of various NSFs for each notification
** Configuration Management : Config subsystem (already implemented)

* *RPC Thread Pool (MD-SAL Core)*:
** Owned by : MD-SAL Core
** Lifecycle managed by : MD-SAL
** Functionality :
*** Executes the business logic from the point of RPC invocation by NSFs
till the point of submitting a message to OFLibrary (towards switches)
*** Special Requirements : None. Current implementation meets the
requirements
*** Configuration Management : Config subsystem (already implemented)

[[rationale-for-using-netty-threadpools]]
== Rationale for Using Netty Threadpools

* Using Netty’s Execution threadpool mechanism would provide
message-ordering per connection out-of-box
* No additional specialized thread-pool design is required
* All other options considered would require extensive design,
implementation and testing efforts. Most of the requirements shall be
met with the Netty Execution Threadpool

[[impact-areas-and-required-code-changes]]
== Impact Areas and Required Code Changes

* *OFLibrary*:
** Changes only to the extent that the configured threadpools are used
by Netty bootstrap code
* *OFPlugin*:
** All current code which uses additional pool of threads (including the
pool which processes/translates messages and one which sends MD-SAL
notifications) must be removed and executing code must be modified to
exploit Netty’s execution thread-pool
** Handhsake part must be made fully asynchronous. Timeout requirements
during handshake phase must use IdleStateHandler of Netty pipeline than
using custom blocking/timeout mechanism
** Message-parsing and priority-assignment functionality to be
incorporated
* *MD-SAL*:
** Changes would be required in Notfication-processing to the extent
that the messages are delivered to NSFs considering
*** Order of reception from session (switch) and Priority-assigned at
plugin layer
* *Clustering*:
** Proposed model would also be amenable with minimal or no changes
while implementing clustering / federation of controllers

[[message-handling-priorities]]
= Message Handling Priorities

[[requirements]]
== Requirements

* Detecting message-type for priority assignment (Openflowplugin)
** Basic parsing to detect type of OFMessage
** Deeper parsing of Packet-Ins – alternatively we can go for cookie to
determine the flow-match and hence the priority (details to be
hashed-out because attaching processing semantics to cookies is arguably
crossing the boundaries of control viz. switches - i.e. we assume that
the switches preserve cookies across all conditions)

* Assigning Priority (Openflowplugin)
** Priority order rules :
*** All topology-influencing OF events (including LLDP Packet-Ins) –
HIGH PRIORITY
*** All other events lower priority
** Priority is assigned at the Openflowplugin level based on
configuration / rules
** In future, we can extend the priority-assignment rules to be
“instructed” by applications in a non-conflicting manner

* Acting based on priority (MD-SAL Core)
** Routing of ingress events based on priority would be functional
responsibility of MD-SAL core
** MD-SAL can exploit the context of sessions (indirectly, switches) to
enforce the priority routing to NSFs (Tony can add more details if
required). This is mainly to prevent individual switch-session context
(across all connection of a given switch) from overwhelming MD-SAL’s
routing

[[plan-of-record]]
== Plan of Record

Agreement for the 1st phase::

* Only prioritize LLDP packets
* Classify in the plugin: install specific flows for LLDP, and use the
match field in the incoming packet for classification of LLDP packets
* Priority dispatch is done in MD-SAL
* Agreement with the thread model as proposed by Muthu (see above)
* Michal needs to fix the way Hello messages are handled in the plugin
