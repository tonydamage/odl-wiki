= Overview and Usecases

\1. Switches can be connected to 1 or more controllers.

\2. From the plugin side, for a given switch only one controller should
act as a Master and other cluster members should be the Slave

\3. The changes should work for a single controller setup as well.

\4. Consensus should be maintained between the cluster members and
failover should be supported

\5. State, if any, should get replicated across the cluster members, for
a switch

\6. Role change should be supported via REST and Command line

\7. Support for a Slave controller to receive Async messages from switch
should be implemented

\8. Controller connected by the switch should be able to join the
existing cluster.

Each controller has a supervisor actor . The supervisor actor is
responsible for receiving the NodeUpdated notification and replicating
the info with other supervisors. Upon receiving the notification,
Supervisors create Election Actors , which in turn kickoff Raft
election, emerging one of the actors as Leader. The Leader then issues
make-slave requests to the other Follower actors, which issue
role-change RPC to make that controller as the SLAVE. The Leader then
makes itself as the Master.

At the start

'''''

\1. Controllers are started with static configuration and seed node
information. Suppose C1, C2 C3 are the controllers. C1 starts as the
seed node. C2 and C3 start with seed node as C1

\2. Each controller node has a supervisor actor. And the supervisor
shares the peer information. Supervisor Actor (SA1, SA2, SA3) gets
created for each node. Supervisors get configured with their peers in
the network, irrespective whether the same switch is connected to that
controller or not

3.Supervisor Actors (SA1, SA2, SA3) subscribe itself for NodeUpdated
Notification

\4. Switch S1 connects to these controllers and NodeUpdated Notification
gets created.

\5. Each of the supervisors receives this notification. They update
their supervisor peers with their about-to-be-created actor information
(actor-name, address). So the Su Actors are all aware of the actors
getting created for switch S1

\6. Then Supervisor SA1 creates actors S1A1, SA2 creates S1A2 and SA3
creates S1A3. They pass the peer information during creation.

\7. Raft Election begins. Leader gets elected.

\8. Leader actor:

`   For each follower in its peer list, a monotonic generationId is created and a create-slave role-change message is issued, making that follower as the arbiter for the slave controller` +
`   Each follower , makes a slave request to ofp. On sucess , it recieves the notification from OFP and updates its state.  {s1 : {c2:slave}} ` +
`   After all followers, the leader issues a create-master role change message to self, making it as the arbiter for the master controller` +
`   On success , it recieves the notification from OFP and updates its state. {s1 : {c1:master}} `

\9. State is synced up using Gossip.

If the leader dies:

'''''

\1. Raft election take place. And a follower becomes leader.

\2. Step 8-9 above are repeated.
