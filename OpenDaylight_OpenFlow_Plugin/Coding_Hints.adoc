If using eclipse, following compiler settings might be useful either
during coding or while fixing errors.

Especially useful warnings are:

* name shadowing
* null checks
* missing case in switch block
* missing break in case
* unused variables/parameters
* annotations checks (@override)
* access to non accessible member of enclosing type
* if overriding hashcode or equals, both must be overriden

And of course warnings upon missing javadoc comments for public classes,
members and methods.
