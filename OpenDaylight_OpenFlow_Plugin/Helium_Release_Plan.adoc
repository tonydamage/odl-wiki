|Table config & Capabilities learning |Table features code already
exists & is also present in the test provider. Beyond what exists - this
optional item will not be enhanced as (1) Most switches including OVS do
not support, (2) TTP is a better mechanism for this & will be supported
in OVS |Table config & Capabilities learning. This item may be removed
if the TTP project renders this less useful - and can be considered an
optional item. |

|New Integration Tests |There are new tests added in the integration
project covering OFPlugin (work in progress) |Expanded coverage of
integration tests (including new tests for the new features).
