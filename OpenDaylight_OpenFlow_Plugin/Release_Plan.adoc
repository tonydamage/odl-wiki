= Proposed OpenFlow Plugin Release Plan

[[introduction]]
== Introduction

The OpenFlow plugin project will develop a plugin to support
implementations of the OpenFlow specification as it develops and
evolves. Specifically the project will continue to provide support for
the existing OpenFlow 1.0 implementation, developing a plugin aiming to
support OpenFlow 1.3.x, and further supporting subsequent OpenFlow
specifications. The plugin shall be implemented in such a way that
existing and future OpenFlow protocol specifications can be integrated
and published for the OpenDaylight controller. [edit]
