Current way to flush a flow to switch looks like this:

1.  create MD-SAL modeled flow and commit it into dataStore using two
phase commit (probably it might be later done through REST)
2.  FRM gets notified and invokes corresponding rpc (addFlow) on
particular service provider (if suitable provider for given node
registered)
3.  the provider (plugin in this case) transforms MD-SAL modeled flow
into OF-API modeled flow
4.  OF-API modeled flow is then flushed into OFLibrary
5.  OFLibrary encodes flow into particular version of wire protocol and
sends it to particular switch
6.  check on mininet side if flow is set

Currently for this purpose there is project test-provider (under
openflowplugin). There are several command providers and the one
handling flows is *OpenflowpluginTestCommandProvider*. Methods, which
can be use as *commands in OSFI-console* have prefix '_'.
