[[openflow-plugin-provides-following-features]]
== OpenFlow Plugin provides following features

1.  Connection handshake with switches supporting 1.3 and 1.0 using OF
Library API's.
2.  Capability exchange with Switch.
3.  Handled multiple connections from switches.
4.  Handle multiple Auxiliary and Main connection from switches.
5.  Role request.
6.  Error handling.
7.  Support OF CRUD operation for Flow, group, meter, stats, etc.
8.  Packet processing.
9.  Support discovery service for topology.
10. Handle and propagate switch events.

[[openflow-plugin-dependencies]]
== OpenFlow Plugin Dependencies

1.  MD-SAL
2.  Hard-SAL
3.  OF Library.

So dependencies should be created in Jenkins as to run integration tests
when any dependencies changes.

[[openflow-plugin-needs-to-be-integrated-with-following-modules]]
== Openflow Plugin needs to be integrated with following modules

1.  Integration with Library.
2.  Integration with MD-SAL.
3.  Integration with Hard-SAL.
4.  MD-SAL, Library and plugin integration.

[[so-each-of-the-above-integration-scenarios-will-have-different-features-to-be-tested]]
== So each of the above integration scenario's will have different
features to be tested

[[integration-with-library]]
=== Integration with Library

:* Connection handshake with switch(Version bitmap and Hello message
exchange.

:* Capability exchange.

:* Handle multiple connection.

:* Handle TCP/TLS/UDP connection.

:* Certificate Management though its Library functionality but still it
would be good to do integration testing.

:* Error Handling.

:* Event Management.

:* Packet processing.

[[easy-way-to-setup-osgi-context-with-felix]]
==== Easy way to setup osgi context with felix

For testing purposes OFPlugin and OFLibrary could be started together
inside of OSGI context. *Requirements:*

* maven >= 3.0.4
* java JDK 1.7
* access to http://nexus.opendaylight.org
* http://felix.apache.org[felix-framework] (look for
org.apache.felix.main.distribution)

*Instructions:*

* place this pom.xml in empty folder **:

 +
`       ``4.0.0` +
`       ``org.opendaylight.openflowplugin` +
`       ``openflowplugin-felix-easy` +
`       ``0.1-SNAPSHOT` +

`       ``0.0.1-SNAPSHOT` +
`       ``test` +
`     ` +
`     ` +
`       ``org.opendaylight.openflowjava` +
`       ``openflow-protocol-impl` +
`       ``0.1-SNAPSHOT` +
`       ``test` +
`     ` +
`   ` +

`       `http://nexus.opendaylight.org/content/repositories/opendaylight.snapshot/[`http://nexus.opendaylight.org/content/repositories/opendaylight.snapshot/`] +
`     ` +
`   ` +

* in ** run: `mvn dependency:copy-dependencies -DoutputDirectory=deps`
* copy jars from */deps* into */bundle/*
* create log4j.xml file containing:

 +
`   ` +
`       ` +
`           ` +
`       ` +
`   ` +
`   ` +
`       ` +
`       ` +
`   ` +
`   ` +
`       ` +
`       ` +
`   ` +
`   ` +
`       ` +
`       ` +
`   ` +

* in ** run:
`java -Dlog4j.configuration=file://<absolute path to log4j.xml> -jar bin/felix.jar`
* now the OFLibrary should be listening in default port (6653) - here
you can connect with switch, communication will be logged into console

[[integration-with-md-sal]]
=== Integration with MD-SAL

:* Registration of RPC method with MD-SAL.

:* Routing the call to right RPC by MD-SAL.

:* Switch notification from plugin to SAL.

:* MD-SAL routing the notification to all registered modules.

[[integration-with-hard-sal]]
=== Integration with Hard-SAL

Will be same as "Integration with MD-SAL.

[[md-sal-library-and-plugin-integration]]
=== MD-SAL, Library and plugin integration

All the above scenario 1 and 2 have to combined and tested.
