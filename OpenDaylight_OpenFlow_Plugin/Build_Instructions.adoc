== Building a Base Edition that has the new openflowplugin

1.  Checkout the openflowplugin project (if you need help with this see
GettingStarted:Pulling,_Hacking,_and_Pushing_All_the_Code_from_the_CLI[Pulling
Hacking and Pushing All the Code from the CLI] ).
2.  cd into the openflowplugin/distribution/base directory
+
::
-----------------------------------
cd openflowplugin/distribution/base
-----------------------------------
3.  Build the distribution
+
::
-----------------
mvn clean install
-----------------
4.  Run the controller
+
::
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cd target/distributions-openflowplugin-base-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-osgipackage/opendaylight/
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------
./run.sh -debug

== Testing controller application module with new openflowplugin

If you want to test your application module that's in under development
stage with the new openflowplugin, following are the two ways:

\1) Push your changes to the controller repository and merge it. Once
new artifacts get publish to nexus repository you can follow above steps
(1-4) to test it.

\2) Build the bundle and its dependency locally and use it with the new
openflowplugin. Fire following command from controller project's root
directory

--------------------------------------------------
mvn clean install -pl :<bundle-name> -amd
e.g mvn clean install -pl :statistics-manager -amd
--------------------------------------------------

Above command will install the new packages to the local maven repo. Now
follow steps mentioned in above section to build the base edition of
openflowplugin project. It will pick up the latest bundle from local
maven repo.

[[remote-debug]]
== Remote debug

The easiest way how to debug OFPlugin is to
link:#Building_a_Base_Edition_that_has_the_new_openflowplugin[start
distribution/base] with *-debug* parameter. This will start jvm with
listening to remote debugger on port *8000* turned on. Now you can
attach your eclipse to this process:

image:Eclipse-remote-debug.png[eclipse-remote-debug,title="eclipse-remote-debug"]

Active breakpoint should look like this (checked):

image:Eclipse-remote-debug-breakpoint.png[active
breakpoint,title="active breakpoint"]

It is not important, which project is the "debugged" one, but if all
projects are added in tab *Source*. Having a project attached to debug
session as source will enable you to step through sources during debug
and place breakpoints.
