== Goals

1.  General
* Stateless operations?
* No affinity in operations?
* Global data such as policies (data distribution to regions)
* Ability to perform global functions?
* Global visualizations?
* Support issues, debugging, tracing, logging
2.  Intra-Region Cluster Expectations
* All members of a given cluster will have the same view of data (i.e.,
essentially a logically shared store)
* All members of a given cluster will have the same bundles installed
and expose the same capabilities
* Ability to place constraints on messages (calls) to prefer or limit
provider set (such as latency, or even same process)
3.  Inter-Region Cluster Expectations
* Separate regions should be able to exercise [some level of] control
over their "region" even if other regions fail or become disconnected
* Messaging between regions should be mostly about control (policy
updates, etc) as opposed to data replication
* Data partitioning

[[colins-opinionated-next-steps]]
== User:Ckd[Colin]'s Opinionated Next Steps

1.  We should just use Akka
* It seems to provide most, if not all, of the features we want
* The people running it seem to really know what they're doing
* They offer concrete, understandable consistency properties that can be
configured
* It's Scala/Java-based
2.  Some of us should just fork off and start testing a version of
OpenDaylight which replaces Infinispan with Akka
3.  In the longer run, we need to find better, more flexible APIs for
things like
* Picking CP vs. AP and specifying merge policies when/if we have AP
* Picking persisted vs. ephemeral state
* Configuring the cluster itself, e.g., potential members
* Specifying sharding/locality information
* Possibly also specifying query optimizations, e.g., should we build
indices on some of the object's keys

[[coarse-next-steps]]
== Coarse Next Steps

1.  Figure out what have now with Infinispan
* Can we figure out what properties it gives us, if any?
* Can we figure out how to make it not suck?
* Is the Infinispan team interested in our use case?
* Is there something simple we can do to bring JGroups up through
Infinispan?
* I think that we have enough evidence than Infinispan doesn't quite do
what we want to move on here. --User:Ckd[Colin]
2.  Figure out if we want to have our own project? Giovanni says yes.
3.  Explore our other options: Akka, Cassandra, Zookeeper, JGroups, etc.
4.  This is all basically just to get us where we should have been at
the Hydrogen release.
* At the same time, there are at least 3 different areas we need to look
at from the point of view of consistency:
1.  What consistency models do we want to have within a “region”? Also
what is a “region”?
2.  Do we want to start talking about inter-regioin consistency and
state exchange?
** Does this also tie into controller federation? Can we avoid this?
3.  What consistency model do we want to provide in the network?
** In particular, how does merging after a partition play into this?

[[big-long-term-questions]]
== Big (Long-Term) Questions

1.  How much state needs to be replicated and where?
* Jan points out that if you push every flowmod to every controller
that’s going to limit your scalability.
* At the same time, state that is logically global has to live
everywhere.
* Exploiting locality seems like a really good idea, but you re doing it
at the risk of being less fault-tolerant.
* We probably want to consider the set of possible controllers for a
given switch to fail over to and make sure that we replicate any state
we might need over to them.
2.  How far can we scale this strongly consistent model?
3.  Are there fundamental trade-offs we’re somehow making by choosing
strong consistency?
* What are they and how can they bite us?
4.  Do we want to have a micro-controller per switch? How might that be
done?
* Could be a full-fledged version of the controller. Could be something
simpler.
5.  Why didn’t we do this with protocols in the past, e.g., OSPF?
* Was it scale? Physical distances? Just not having the right tools?
* What does 4D have to say about this?
