=== Major Features

Hydrogen release marks the first release of netconf server and config
subsystem. Most notable features:

* Configuration system capable of two phase commit
* Configuration APIs and SPIs exposed via JMX config beans
* Runtime statistics and other data exposed via JMX runtime beans
* yang code generator to generate JMX, configuration interfaces and
skeletons of Modules and ModuleFactories
* netconf server (plain TCP and ssh) is used as config-subsystem
endpoint, wraps JMX config and runtime beans into model driven XML
representation
* netconf client with advanced capabilities like reconnection strategies
and capability testing
* configuration pusher and persister that delivers initial or current
configuration, automatic persisting of changes after netconf commit
* netconf monitoring capability in netconf server
* many low level Java APIs wrapped with yang models and configuration
factories, like executor framework, netty threadgroups, logback
* shutdown management via netconf RPC

[[known-issues-and-limitations]]
=== Known Issues and Limitations

Security is currently limited to authentication based on UserManager
service and ssh endpoint only. There is no authorization implemented -
as long as user logs into netconf, there is no way of limiting RPCs
called or configuration being changed.
