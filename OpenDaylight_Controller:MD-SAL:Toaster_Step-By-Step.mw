The following documentation will take you through creating a "toaster" plugin. We will start with simple definitions of a toaster that enable CRUD (create/read/update/delete) of configuration data only, and advance to a sophisticated model that has both remote procedure calls, notifications and a specialized ODL controller which provides additional business logic.

'''NOTE: The follow documentation is a work in progress and may have embedded questions and answers. Look for QUESTION to find existing questions.'''
