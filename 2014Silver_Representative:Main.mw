===Statement Of Interest===
I am seeking a seat on the OpenDaylight Board of Directors to pursue the interests of all Silver members, 
as well as the overall interests of ODL. 
After participating in the OpenDaylight Summit, it was clear that ODL will play an increasingly important 
role in the evolution of SDN. Open source is at the forefront of an industry transformation driving new 
technology adoption, in response to emerging use cases and standards. The tremendous growth in ODL 
participation, especially among new Silver Members, and strong collaboration set the stage for a highly 
successful 2014. 
My extensive standardization experience with progressive and highly community-oriented bodies (Open 
Networking Foundation and ETSI NFV ISG) aptly prepares me for this unique role on the ODL Board, 
which is to advocate for peer organizations spanning a cross section of the industry. If elected the Silver 
Board member, I intend to represent the Silver member collective interests, prevailing over competitive 
forces and individual company interests. 
As the Chairman of the ONF Market Education Committee (MEC), and an active member of the ONF 
Council of Chairs (ONF leadership team), I have been achieving those goals since the MEC was formed in 
late 2011. Since that time, we have published the ONF SDN White Paper and 8 Solution Briefs with 
diverse, inclusive, and highly collaborative project teams. 
I also serve as the liaison between the ONF and Open Networking User Group, and have organized 
highly successful workshops for the Open Networking Summit, Layer123 for the SDN & OpenFlow World 
and APAC Congress events, and SDN Central, where I have published the popular NFV Insider’s series. 
Ciena recently announced that our Controller will be adopting ODL, and has begun to contribute to the 
ODL in the integration area. We are already gearing up to increase our contributions in 2014 and 
beyond. 
With strong, senior-level corporate support, and both a company and personal stake, I am committed to 
ODL success. 
Thank you for the opportunity to ensure proactive and effective representation in the interests of all 
Silver-level members.
