===Statement Of Interest===
I am seeking a seat on the OpenDaylight Board of Directors to pursue the interests of all Silver members, 
as well as the overall interests of ODL. 
After participating in the OpenDaylight Summit, it was clear that ODL will play an increasingly important 
role in the evolution of SDN. Open source is at the forefront of an industry transformation driving new 
technology adoption, in response to emerging use cases and standards. The tremendous growth in ODL 
participation, especially among new Silver Members, and strong collaboration set the stage for a highly 
successful 2014. 
My extensive standardization experience with progressive and highly community-oriented bodies (Open 
Networking Foundation and ETSI NFV ISG) aptly prepares me for this unique role on the ODL Board, 
which is to advocate for peer organizations spanning a cross section of the industry. If elected the Silver 
Board member, I intend to represent the Silver member collective interests, prevailing over competitive 
forces and individual company interests. 
As the Chairman of the ONF Market Education Committee (MEC), and an active member of the ONF 
Council of Chairs (ONF leadership team), I have been achieving those goals since the MEC was formed in 
late 2011. Since that time, we have published the ONF SDN White Paper and 8 Solution Briefs with 
diverse, inclusive, and highly collaborative project teams. 
I also serve as the liaison between the ONF and Open Networking User Group, and have organized 
highly successful workshops for the Open Networking Summit, Layer123 for the SDN & OpenFlow World 
and APAC Congress events, and SDN Central, where I have published the popular NFV Insider’s series. 
Ciena recently announced that our Controller will be adopting ODL, and has begun to contribute to the 
ODL in the integration area. We are already gearing up to increase our contributions in 2014 and 
beyond. 
With strong, senior-level corporate support, and both a company and personal stake, I am committed to 
ODL success. 
Thank you for the opportunity to ensure proactive and effective representation in the interests of all 
Silver-level members.

Assets 
* Proven track record for bringing together disparate organizations to promote the greater industry goals 
* Contemporary experience working with the ONF, ETSI NFV ISG, and ONUG leadership teams 
* Strong commitment to ODL with increasing code contributions and ODL-based Controller product announcement 
* Highly collaborative and pragmatic style that achieves diversity and inclusiveness 
* Extensive product management and product marketing background, balancing both strategic and tactical considerations 
* Strong executive-level backing throughout the company 
* Professional and personal integrity 

== Mathieu Lemay - Inocybe Technologies ==
[[File:MLemay.jpg |200px|thumb|right]]

===Bio===
Mathieu Lemay is CEO of Inocybe Technologies a company specialized in Smart & Sustainable IT Infrastructures. He is also CTO of Civimetrix Telecom  an infrastructure provider company specialized in democratizing ultra-broadband Fiber to the Home (FTTH) as an economic development tool for under-served communities.

Mathieu has more than 20 years of experience in information technology. At the age of 10 he was programming C++, ADA and x86 ASM and then got involved in networking from the early Bulletin Board Systems to the first age of commodity Internet. He then pursued with a college, bachelor and masters degree in Electrical Engineering with speciality in Wireless and Optical Telecommunications. 

In 2001, he started working at Communication's Research Centre (CRC) in Canada where he worked on teams who pioneered User Empowered Networking through directed research called User Controlled LightPaths (UCLP). Still used in some research and education networks to provide Network-as-a-Service (NaaS), it also inspired the Global Environment for Network Innovation (GENI) initiative and some early Software Defined Networks and Virtualization paradigms. In 2005, he founded Inocybe Technologies to promote infrastructure multi-tenancy and simplicity. While stronger evangelist of the Virtual Network Element model, Inocybe has worked with OpenFlow since its inception at Stanford University and partnered with local universities in a project called Netvirt which led to the creation of the SDN startup called NoviFlow. In 2010, Inocybe Technologies, CRC and École de Technologie Supérieure created the world's first Zero Carbon Network where traffic and compute would move based on site's renewable energy's availability and led to our involvement in using a modified OpenStack distribution for Green Cloud operations. Inocybe has joined OpenDaylight in June 2013 and has launched its first OpenDaylight distribution at the February Summit.

===Statement Of Interest===
In our first OpenDaylight year we haven't been much involved. Inocybe is very small company but we have worked on a developing a full technology stack over the past 9 years of operations. As such, we had to finish some missing pieces first. We are now eager to get involved and take the required leadership to bring benefits to the entire community. It is the reason why I am applying as a candidate for this Silver Member election. We just recently got involved following our distribution release of Inocybe OpenDaylight and we plan to be directly involved for the long term. As the CEO of one of the smallest company in OpenDaylight, I think I can bring other perspectives to the discussions and possibly make things happen that are more difficult to execute in larger corporate environments. Finally, through our FTTH deployments we also plan to massively deploy OpenDaylight which is one of the reason that we strive to help make OpenDaylight the best open-source SDN framework available. I will promote help promote OpenDaylight as much as I can in my partnerships and events.

===Statement Of Interest===
My employer, Huawei, is the leading ICT (information and communication technology) company in China. Huawei treats open as its core value and spares no efforts pushing for a wider adoption of international standards and open source projects in China. Huawei is actively leading or contributing in more than 100 international standard organizations and open source communities. We observe the great value of Open Daylight as the leading SDN community. Recently, Huawei built and opened “East Test Lab” which allowed users around the world, especially those from China, to try Open Daylight.
 
I want to serve on the Open Daylight Board of Directors. From this position, Huawei not only strengthens our commitments in Open Daylight community, but also increases the power when we negotiate with other China companies for adopting and contributing to Open Daylight project.
