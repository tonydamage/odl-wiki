SDNSim(SDN Simulation platform)

[[description]]
== Description

SDN simulation platform provides users with a software development and
testing environment, and users develop applications that can be tested
at any time in the SDN simulation platform, simulation platform will
provide virtual resources development needs, such as computing, storage
and networks. Therefore, there will be three phases in this project, as
follows. (1) core simulation engine: to provide basic resources. (2)
core emulation layer: to provide network service functions. (3) sim code
layer: to provide users to write code.

The following figure depicts the described components.
