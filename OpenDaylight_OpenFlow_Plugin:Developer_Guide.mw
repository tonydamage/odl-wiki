=OpenFlow Plugin Project Developer Guide=

Below are topics which are developer specific and which have not been covered under the user guide. Please follow the OpenFlow plugin user guide first.

== Important dependant distributions ==
Some projects contain distributions which depends on OFPlugin and can be easily broken. In case of upcomming change in OFPlugin capable of breaking them 
(dependency change, configSubsystem change, stinky suspect wild hack change.. etc.) these distribution should be tested on ('''before merge''') :
* ability to start and listen on default openflow ports (6633, 6653)
* ability to connect mininet with at least tree,2 topology
* ability to list mininet nodes via restconf
If there are issues, try to retest using OFPlugin without the change in order to prove that OFPlugin is the cause. Then either push fixes to those distributions or contact developers.
This way we can avoid blocking people developing against those distributions.

Those distributions are:
* local plugin base distro: https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/gitweb?p=openflowplugin.git;a=tree;f=distribution/base;hb=HEAD
* [[CrossProject:Integration_Group|integration]] base distro: https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/gitweb?p=integration.git;a=tree;f=distributions/base;hb=HEAD
* [[OVSDB_Integration:Main|ovsdb]] opendaylight distro: https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/gitweb?p=ovsdb.git;a=tree;f=distribution/opendaylight;hb=HEAD
