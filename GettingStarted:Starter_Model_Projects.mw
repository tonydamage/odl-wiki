== Description ==

The yangtools allows a simple model to be written in yang and a lot of useful Java code to be generated from it.  It would be helpful to have
 a simple starter project into which folks could simply copy into their git repos and copy in their yang files and get going.

== Deliverables ==

# A 'modelstarter/' maven project that could be copied into folks git repo, renamed, and edited slightly to get going with a yang model
# A wiki page describing how to adapt model starter for use to start a new model maven project.

== Pointers ==

# Start by checking out yang tools with
#: <pre>git clone ssh://<username>@git.opendaylight.org:29418/yangtools.git</pre>
# Build it with
#: <pre>mvn clean install</pre>
# Look at code-generator/samples/modeling-sample as a simple example project
# Use it as as starting point to create a new modelstarter project.
## Note: The existing modeling-sample depends on building the whole yangtools from the top level
so you will need to break it off to build independently.
