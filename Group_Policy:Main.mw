== Introduction ==
The group-based policy project defines an application-centric policy model for OpenDaylight that separates information about application connectivity requirements from information about the underlying details of the network infrastructure.  

This approach offers a number of distinct advantages, including:
* Easier, application-focused way of expressing policy: By creating policies that mirror application semantics, this framework provides a simpler, self-documenting mechanism for capturing policy requirements without requiring detailed knowledge of networking.
* Improved automation: Grouping constructs allow higher level automation tools to easily manipulate groups of network endpoints simultaneously.
* Consistency: By grouping endpoints and applying policy to groups, the framework offers a consistent and concise way to handle policy changes
* Extensible policy model: Since the policy model is abstract and not tied to specific network implementations, it can easily capture connectivity, security, L4-7, QoS, etc.
