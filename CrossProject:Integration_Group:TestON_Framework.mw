== Introduction ==

TestON is an end to end automation framework for testing the Openflow/SDN components. Run
across various components in an OpenFlow topology. This solution aims to provide an
automation framework, that is not just exhaustive in coverage, but also makes it easy to
debug and author scripts. It allows for authoring scripts in OpenSpeak (plain English) format
and can be run standalone from the command line
