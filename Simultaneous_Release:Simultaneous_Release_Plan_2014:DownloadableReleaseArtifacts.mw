This page describes the downloadable artifacts for each edition. Documentation is included for context but the details are covered under other tasks. The layout of this page is just a layout to show the details and not the final download page as it will look at release. The names and tags are subject to change.

Investigation is ongoing with some projects like Defense4All, OpenDove and VTN in the virtualization and service provider editions.
