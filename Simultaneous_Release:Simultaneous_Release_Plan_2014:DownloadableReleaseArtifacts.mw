*The layout of this page is only for visualizing the different artifacts per edition and not how the final download page will look at release.
*The names and tags are subject to change.
*Investigation is ongoing with some projects like Defense4All, OpenDove and VTN in the virtualization and service provider editions.

=Notes=
* VMs are not unique per edition. Each VM supports all three editions. Each edition in a different folder.
[[CrossProject:Integration_Group:Test_VMs| CrossProject:Integration Group:Test VMs]]
*docker: David Bainbridge is working on docker linux containers for all editions
*VM size: efforts to reduce the size of the VMs. Most include mininet and OepnFlow dissectors as well as desktop versions so it might be difficult to keep the size down.
* Virtualization and Service Provider investigation (Chris Price):
**Virt edition:  (looks like a linux only distro)
***VTN runs RHEL/CentOS with detailed install needs (should be scriptable)
***https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Installation:Virtualization_Edition
***OpenDove runs Linux only, Anees coming back with details
***Defense4All runs linux only (need to dig a little more)
**Carrier edition looks like a linux only distro)
***Defense4All runs linux only (need to dig a little more)
** What other artifacts are required? Extra install steps?
***Defense4All: extra Cassandra configuration done via rpm or deb post install steps.
***OpenDove
***VTN
* Should we add the following:
**Add links for OVS, OpenStack, OVSDB, Mininet?
**Tuturial or development links?
*Documentation: Rob Dolin, Chris Price
* Windows: Rob Dolin: Anything that needs to be identified?
* Download page: Phil Robb
* Versions for everything?
* source zips? Development links?
