'''<big><big>Downloadable Release Artifacts</big></big>'''

This page describes the downloadable release artifacts for each edition.

Disclaimers:
*Documentation artifacts are included for context but the details are covered under other tasks.
*The layout of this page is only for visualizing the different artifacts per edition and not how the final download page will look at release.
*The names and tags are subject to change.
*Investigation is ongoing with some projects like Defense4All, OpenDove and VTN in the virtualization and service provider editions.

=Notes=
* VMs are not unique per edition. Each VM supports all three editions. Each edition in a different folder. The VMs are the integration VMs and as such mainly contain anything installed via the edition zip files, so non-java or non-osgi artifacts may not be there.
[[CrossProject:Integration_Group:Test_VMs| CrossProject:Integration Group:Test VMs]]
* VMs for OpenDove and VTN: projects are working on possible VMs. The existing integration VMs may not be the right place to add the extra OpenDove or VTN pieces which is why the projects may spin their own if possible by release. 
*docker: David Bainbridge is working on docker linux containers for all editions
*VM size: efforts to reduce the size of the VMs. Most include mininet and OpenFlow dissectors as well as desktop versions so it might be difficult to keep the size down.
* Virtualization and Service Provider investigation (Chris Price):
**Virt edition:  (looks like a linux only distro)
***VTN runs RHEL/CentOS with detailed install needs (should be scriptable)
***https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Installation:Virtualization_Edition
***OpenDove runs Linux only, Anees coming back with details
***Defense4All runs linux only (need to dig a little more)
**Carrier edition looks like a linux only distro)
***Defense4All runs linux only (need to dig a little more)
** What other artifacts are required? Extra install steps?
***Defense4All: extra Cassandra configuration done via rpm or deb post install steps.
***OpenDove
***VTN
* Should we add the following:
**Add links for OVS, OpenStack, OVSDB, Mininet?
**Tuturial or development links?
*Documentation: Rob Dolin, Chris Price
* Windows: Rob Dolin: Anything that needs to be identified?
* Download page: Phil Robb
* Versions for everything?
* source zips? Development links?
