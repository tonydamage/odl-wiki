=Overview=
There are 2 kinds of messaging exchange pattern supported by MD-SAL
# Request/Reply
# Publish/Subscribe

Request/Reply pattern is implemented by rpc module. Publish/Subscribe functionality is provided by notification module. The implementation details are provided on this page: [[OpenDaylight_Controller:MD-SAL:Explained:Messaging_Patterns]]

This wiki only focuses on Publish/Subscribe implementation. Pre-helium implementation assumes a single vm deployment of controller. The message exchange happens only within a VM in memory. The requirement for helium is to enable these notifications across nodes in the cluster.

There are 2 kinds of Publish/Subscribe notifications:
#Data Change events
#Yang notifications

In both cases, the notifications are broadcasted to all "listeners".

=Requirement=
We should be able to publish notifications to any subscriber in the cluster. A lot has been discussed on the thread [https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/controller-dev/2014-July/005923.html here]

==Issue==
When controller is deployed in a cluster with ''n'' nodes, there will be "n" instances of an application running in the cluster. All these instances would subscribe to the same event and will receive notification. 
=Proposal for helium=
Based on the discussion in the mailing list thread
