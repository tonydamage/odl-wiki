= Potential Items For Helium Release =

* [[OpenDaylight OpenFlow Plugin:Backlog|Backlogs from Hydrogen]] - few from there noted below
** TLS support
** Table config and capabilities learning .
** Port config.
** Queue config.
** DTLS based connection establishment not supported.
** Role request not supported.
** Make the OpenDaylight GUI 1.3 aware (not exactly plugin specific feature - just capturing here anyway). Example: to be able to configure 1.3 style flows, meters and groups.

* OpenFlow 1.4 Support ?? (May be implement some key features as extensions on top of OpenFlow 1.3 if whole 1.4 found to be too aggressive?? )
** B.14.1 (from OF 1.4 spec) : More extensible wire protocol. Make the OpenFlow protocol more TLV based - may be a little extensive.
** B.14.2 : More descriptive reasons for packet-in. This should be easy to implement
** B.14.3 Optical port properties. This may not be hard to implement - but may be hard to test
** B.14.4 Flow-removed reason for meter delete - should be a straightforward addition
** B.14.5 Flow monitoring. This is in multi controller environment. It allows a controller to monitor in real time the changes to any subsets of the flow table done by other controllers. May be a stretch for Helium - as we do not even support the multi controller features from OpenFlow 1.3 (example - role request).
** B.14.7 Eviction
** B.14.8 Vacancy events
** B.14.9 Bundles
** B.14.10 Synchronised tables
** B.14.11 Group and Meter change notifications
** B.14.12 Error code for bad priority
** B.14.13 Error code for Set-async-config
** B.14.14 PBB UCA header field
** B.14.15 Error code for duplicate instruction
** B.14.16 Error code for multipart timeout
** B.14.17 Change default TCP port to 6653 - done

* OpenFlow Config Protocol ??
* Changes required by Negotiable Datapath Model project ??
