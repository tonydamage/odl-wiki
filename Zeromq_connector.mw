==Rpc Routing==

===Rpc Requester===

# Broker asks 0mq router to invoke rpc on remote vm
# 0mq router looks up routing table to find location of service
# If a remote location is NOT found, send exception (or RpcResult) back to broker
# If remote location is found, create a callable task and give it to the executor pool.
## The callable tasks needs to establish a connection with the remote location and send the rpc request. The socket connection must be closed in this thread.
### Optimization - Maintain a socket connection pool, 1 connection per host. The trick with this optimization is thread-safety. 0mq sockets are not thread-safe. Sockets should only be used and closed in the thread that created it. Check how to connect one client (REQ) socket to multiple servers (REP) sockets. Or use ROUTER sockets instead.
## The callable task will block the thread and wait for the response to come back.
### Optimization - Invoke RPC in a non-blocking way.
## The callable task will deserialize the response and create a RpcResult object
## The callable task will handle zmq errors and create a RpcResult object
## The callable task will return a Future<RpcResult>.
## Handle thread-kill situations and create a RpcResult object
# Return a Future<RpcResult> back to broker


====Reconnect and Retries====
* In case of network failure, the "client" component will try to reconnect. During the reconnect, it will mark the 0mq router as "unavailable".
* In the case when server dies, the "client" component will retry the message for a configured number of times after which it will mark the server as "unreachable".

===Provider===
# 0mq router receives a rpc request
# 0mq router deserializes the request. In case of exception, create a message with error and reply back.
# 0mq router creates a RpcRequest and asks the broker to execute. In case of exception, create a message with error and reply back.
## Optimization - call the broker non-blockingly
# 0mq router serializes the response.
