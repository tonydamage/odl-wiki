The OpenDaylight Group-Based Policy project defines and implements an
application-centric *intent* interface for Developers and Operators.

It achieves this by:

* associating applications with the same communication requirements into
*groups*
* enforcing *contracts* representing the application's communication
requirements between *groups*

This approach allows for the *_"separation of concerns"_* between
application connectivity requirements and the details of the underlying
network infrastructure.

The advantages of this approach are:

* *Intent based semantics*: Developers/Operators can define policies
describing their application's network Intent. This defines *WHAT* an
application wishes to communicate with, not *HOW*. The resulting
metadata is abstract and not tied to specific network implementations
therefore:
** can be implemented by any *renderer* able to provide the required
capabilities to fulfill the Intent.
** enables portability between implementations.
** it can easily capture connectivity, redirection, security, L4-7, QoS
etc
* *Automation and Consistency*: Implemented as a continual feedback loop
between: Intent/Policy, Renderers/Capabilities, Operational Policy,
Governance.
