=== To run the OpenDaylight controller with the new OpenFlow 1.0/1.3 (new) plugin ===
There are 2 ways. In integration project the plugin version is controlled by startup parameter. Or there is distribution build available directly in openflowplugin project.
# use '''integration/distributions/base''' project
#* download and unzip latest build from http://nexus.opendaylight.org/content/repositories/opendaylight.snapshot/org/opendaylight/integration/distributions-base
#: <tt>cd opendaylight</tt>
#* or clone and build '''integration''' project: 
#: <tt>git clone https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/p/integration.git</tt> 
#: <tt>cd integration/distributions/base</tt>
#: <tt>mvn clean install</tt>
#: <tt>cd target/distributions-base-???-SNAPSHOT-osgipackage/opendaylight</tt>
#* and finally run
#: <pre>./run.sh -of13</pre>
# use '''openflowplugin''' project
