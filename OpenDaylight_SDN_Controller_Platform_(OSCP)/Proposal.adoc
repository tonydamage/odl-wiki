== Description

The OpenDaylight SDN Controller Platform is the network application
platform providing unified network intelligence, enterprise-class
scalability and high availability, and a platform to deploy a wide range
of network applications, including data center network virtualization.
OSCP uses industry standard protocols, like OpenFlow, to create a common
abstraction and universal data model for the underlying network data
plane elements. When combined with open and published application
programming interfaces (APIs), OSCP offer the most flexible platform to
deploy universal, network-wide applications. Features include:

* Topologies: Support for non-OF networks, VLAN-network tagging
* High Availability (active/standby)
* OpenFlow Support
* Management features:
** REST API
** Command Line Interface (CLI)
** SNMP
** Graphical User Interface (GUI) for monitoring
** Statistics (CPU, RAM/Disk utilization)
** Controller-Switch message tracing
** Syslog
** NTP
** Management/Control interface separation

* Switch Support
** Virtual Switches
*** Open vSwitch (OVS)
** Hardware Switches
*** Arista 7050
*** Brocade MLXe
*** Brocade CER
*** Brocade CES
*** Extreme Summit x440, x460, x670
*** Huawei openflow-capable router platforms
*** HP 3500, 3500yl, 5400zl, 6200yl, 6600, and 8200zl (the old-style L3
hardware match platform)
*** HP V2 line cards in the 5400zl and 8200zl (the newer L2 hardware
match platform)
*** IBM 8264
*** Juniper (MX, EX)
*** NEC IP8800
*** NEC PF5240
*** NEC PF5820
*** NetGear 7328SO
*** NetGear 7352SO
*** Pronto (3290, 3295, 3780) - runs the shipping pica8 software
*** Switch Light platform
