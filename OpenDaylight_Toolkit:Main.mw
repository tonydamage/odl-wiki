# ['''optional'''] Install the necessary web bower components, under directories ''web/src/main/resources/js'' and ''web/src/main/resources/css'' issue '''bower install'''

# ['''important'''] Install the base controller, within root directory (where common, main, web are located) issue '''mvn clean install'''
# Then go into one of the apps you just generated and issue '''mvn clean install''' to install that bundle
# Then start the controller under ''main/target/main-osgipackage/opendaylight'' and '''./run.sh -console'''
# ['''optional'''] If you installed the bower components, you can access the toolkit web UI at http://localhost:8080

==== Troubleshoot ====

Very rough workaround, if you're seeing a similar problem regarding Maven

<small>[ERROR] Failed to execute goal on project app: Could not resolve dependencies for project org.opendaylight.phoenix:app:bundle:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT: Failed to collect dependencies for [org.opendaylight.phoenix:web:jar:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT (compile), org.opendaylight.controller:sal:jar:0.8.1-SNAPSHOT (compile), org.springframework:spring-web:jar:4.0.2.RELEASE (compile)]: Failed to read artifact descriptor for org.opendaylight.phoenix:web:jar:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT: Failure to find org.opendaylight.phoenix:common:pom:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT in http://nexus.opendaylight.org/content/repositories/opendaylight.snapshot/ was cached in the local repository, resolution will not be reattempted until the update interval of opendaylight-snapshot has elapsed or updates are forced -> [Help 1]</small>
