=== Simple & Node ===

As of June 2014, the project comes with a sample simple application and a tool directory where the web development environment is located. Here are the instructions to run this setup:

1 '''mvn clean install''' within the root directory

2 '''mvn clean install''' within the samples/simple directory

3 Start the controller under ''main/target/main-osgipackage/opendaylight'' and '''./run.sh -console'''

4 Provision your CORS filter, under kit/provision run the provision.js node application

5 Then start the server '''node server.js''' within the tool/node directory

Go to <your_ip>:8000 to start developing your simple web application. The simple web application will access the northbound APIs of your simple application at <your_ip>:8080
