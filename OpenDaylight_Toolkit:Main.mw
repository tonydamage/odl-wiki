= OpenDaylight Toolkit =
OpenDaylight Toolkit is a framework to enabled developers to easily develop applications on top of the OpenDaylight controller. Our goal is to be infrastructure independent and allow developers to develop application on top of multiple platforms.

Objectives:
* Repository of Archetypes for various use-cases. The use-cases may include app development, infrastructure component development, southbound plugin development, Custom distribution, user interface, northbound APIs, apps using northbound REST APIs, etc.
* Provide the Archetypes catalog for OpenDaylight
* In addition to the code and related resources, these Archetype templates can also include necessary development toolkits such as eclipse launchers, debug helpers, etc.

== Getting Started ==
=== [Draft] Getting Started on Linux ===

The project comes with a sample simple application and a tool directory where the web development environment is located. Here are the instructions to run this setup:

# git clone https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/p/toolkit.git
# '''mvn clean install''' within the root directory
# '''mvn clean install''' within the samples/simple directory
# Start the controller under ''main/target/main-osgipackage/opendaylight'' and '''./run.sh -console'''
# Provision your CORS filter, under kit/provision run the provision.js node application
# Then start the server '''node server.js''' within the tool/node directory

Go to <your_ip>:8000 to start developing your simple web application. The simple web application will access the northbound APIs of your simple application at <your_ip>:8080
