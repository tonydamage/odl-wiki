=== [Draft] Getting Started on Linux ===

The project comes with a sample simple application and a tool directory where the web development environment is located. Here are the instructions to run this setup:

# git clone https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/p/toolkit.git
# '''mvn clean install''' within the root directory
# '''mvn clean install''' within the samples/simple directory
# Start the controller under ''main/target/main-osgipackage/opendaylight'' and '''./run.sh -console'''
# Provision your CORS filter, under kit/provision run the provision.js node application
# Then start the server '''node server.js''' within the tool/node directory

Go to <your_ip>:8000 to start developing your simple web application. The simple web application will access the northbound APIs of your simple application at <your_ip>:8080
