1:50:28 PM mlemay I don't have the bot in yet<br />
1:50:36 PM mlemay I asked andrew too late<br />
1:50:42 PM mlemay it'S ok<br />
1:53:06 PM mlemay so paul.. any initial thoughts<br />
1:53:16 PM mlemay guess no one else wanted to join in<br />
1:53:24 PM mlemay to the meeting<br />
1:53:32 PM phudgins it's not 14:00 yet<br />
1:55:49 PM mlemay ahh hok<br />
1:55:54 PM mlemay I'll wait a bit<br />
2:02:30 PM mlemay Hi Paul.. .thanks for coming over<br />
2:02:39 PM mlemay I'll save the log as I don't have meetbot yet<br />
2:03:44 PM phudgins seems lonely in here<br />
2:03:49 PM mlemay yea definitely<br />
2:04:06 PM mlemay do you think people didn't understand the slide deck?<br />
2:04:13 PM mlemay I would expect rdvp to be in<br />
2:04:22 PM phudgins strange that nobody else is interested enough to attend<br />
2:04:50 PM phudgins perhaps we should announce it on the opendaylight now<br />
2:04:50 PM mlemay it was short noticed<br />
2:05:04 PM mlemay I'll hold a couple of other call post creation if it gets approved<br />
2:05:32 PM mlemay ok will do<br />
2:07:38 PM <br />
rhq joined the channel.<br />
2:07:40 PM phudgins perhaps folks will trickle over now<br />
2:09:10 PM mlemay hi rhq<br />
2:09:26 PM phudgins Overall I agree with the need for both a multi-layer model and a reservation mechanism to provision and deprovision at future times<br />
2:10:05 PM phudgins both of these &quot;features&quot; are things we are currently working on<br />
2:10:33 PM phudgins so it makes a lot of sense for us to combine our efforts<br />
2:11:05 PM mlemay right paul.. just a FYI, (vWAN/DRAC) was based some of our early work and we're still working with some of your people on that topic<br />
2:11:25 PM mlemay #topic Introductions<br />
2:11:34 PM mlemay I guess I'll start with introduction<br />
2:11:40 PM mlemay I'm Mathieu Lemay (Inocybe Technologies)<br />
2:12:01 PM phudgins I'm Paul Hudgins (CIENA)<br />
2:13:19 PM phudgins rhq will remain anonymous?<br />
2:14:46 PM mlemay rhq?<br />
2:16:19 PM phudgins so what's next after introductions?<br />
2:16:30 PM mlemay right I was about to go forward<br />
2:16:41 PM mlemay #topic Proposal Introduction<br />
2:16:50 PM mlemay Did everyone see the slides I sent out<br />
2:17:04 PM phudgins +1<br />
2:17:19 PM mlemay #topic Proposal feedback<br />
2:17:29 PM mlemay Any initial feedback on prposal before TSC review?<br />
2:17:55 PM mlemay of course it can change in form but concept will remain the same if there is no obejction from the community<br />
2:18:51 PM phudgins I am already a believer that this functionality is needed in ODL. Will this be the case for the TSC members or will there need to be more motivation?<br />
2:19:37 PM mlemay I might hit a wall a bit but I should be able to get some convinced<br />
2:19:52 PM mlemay feel free to join in tomorrow on the tsc<br />
2:20:06 PM phudgins It is on my calendar already<br />
2:20:07 PM mlemay want to be invoveled in th eprposal?<br />
2:20:20 PM mlemay resource comitted<br />
2:21:14 PM phudgins of course I don't have the final say in who gets &quot;commited&quot; but I don't see why we can't at this point<br />
2:21:46 PM mlemay for sure and I was told taht can change<br />
2:22:01 PM mlemay initially thy simply want to get the projects going<br />
2:22:04 PM phudgins in other words - we will have to reach some consensus on the implementation before my superiors will commit<br />
2:22:05 PM mlemay so that we don't miss helieum<br />
2:22:10 PM mlemay wE'll have design sessions etc<br />
2:22:13 PM mlemay right after<br />
2:22:28 PM mlemay works for me<br />
2:22:39 PM phudgins agreed - so yes, we are committed to begin discussions<br />
2:22:40 PM mlemay are you working with people from CTO office?<br />
2:22:58 PM mlemay had sessions with Michael Ward recently<br />
2:22:58 PM phudgins yes<br />
2:23:11 PM mlemay (Also I know Rod Wilson quite well)<br />
2:23:11 PM rhq I'm Ralph Quapp (ALU)<br />
2:23:20 PM mlemay hi Ralph<br />
2:23:23 PM phudgins not recently<br />
2:23:28 PM phudgins hi Ralph<br />
2:23:50 PM mlemay did you get a chance to see proposal?<br />
2:24:01 PM rhq Not yet<br />
2:25:14 PM mlemay ok<br />
2:25:25 PM mlemay please have a look and let me know if you would be interested in the project<br />
2:25:43 PM mlemay you can catch me on e-mail too if you have questions<br />
2:25:48 PM mlemay mlemay@inocybe.com<br />
2:26:59 PM rhq Thanks, at this point only interested as observer<br />
2:27:55 PM mlemay ok no problems<br />
2:28:17 PM mlemay anyways the project will form a bit more over the upcoming days<br />
2:28:29 PM mlemay as I was mentioning I need to present to TSC<br />
2:28:41 PM mlemay Paul feeel free to change wiki page for proposal as you see fit<br />
2:29:30 PM phudgins this will be the first time through a TSC project proposal - not sure what to expect<br />
2:30:48 PM phudgins how tied to the OGF NSI interface do you think will be desired?<br />
2:31:20 PM mlemay diddo<br />
2:31:23 PM mlemay I have two at the same time<br />
2:31:29 PM mlemay (docs+reservation)<br />
2:31:29 PM phudgins our marketing folks don't see much interest from service providers (different story in the R&amp;D community)<br />
2:31:34 PM mlemay yea<br />
2:31:36 PM mlemay +1<br />
2:32:33 PM phudgins our work is moving towards supporting the ONF Optical Transport Working Group (OTWG) information model<br />
2:32:48 PM mlemay yes<br />
2:32:52 PM mlemay I've seen that too<br />
2:32:55 PM phudgins which in itself is trying to align with the TMF model<br />
2:32:59 PM mlemay should I add that to proposal<br />
2:33:15 PM mlemay I'm not particulaly fond of NSI<br />
2:33:24 PM phudgins the ONF is a closed group<br />
2:33:32 PM mlemay but not really caring about northbound either<br />
2:34:07 PM mlemay (I didn't join ONF for particular reasons but not against moving some of these things in here)<br />
2:34:31 PM phudgins we are utilizing this OTWG model internally, not just a northbound IF<br />
2:35:13 PM phudgins let me find out how restrictive the ONF is on this<br />
2:35:51 PM mlemay ok I still have access to ONF docs (as we created teh startup Noviflow who are members)<br />
2:36:07 PM phudgins Another potential negative is that this model is not mature - still being worked on in the working group<br />
2:36:23 PM mlemay it might nudge me more in ONF<br />
2:37:00 PM phudgins access is one thing, making an implementation open source may be frowned upon<br />
2:37:06 PM mlemay I was involved in OF pre-ONF and had some concerns on ONF when it launched<br />
2:37:29 PM mlemay isn't that the purpose?<br />
2:37:44 PM mlemay (partially)<br />
2:38:03 PM mlemay othwersie better jsut use TMF stuff<br />
2:38:09 PM mlemay or proprietary models<br />
2:38:12 PM mlemay we have that already<br />
2:38:46 PM phudgins since they are attempting at aligning, TMF could always be a fallback<br />
2:38:50 PM mlemay yea<br />
2:38:57 PM mlemay works for me<br />
2:39:06 PM mlemay do you wish me to add some of that to proposal?<br />
2:39:15 PM mlemay (as exploratory)<br />
2:39:28 PM mlemay (optional)<br />
2:39:43 PM phudgins I'll need to have further discussions with our ONF representatives to ensure we are not crossing any lines<br />
2:41:34 PM phudgins we can add this as an &quot;intent&quot; with the constraint of ensuring no legal boundaries are crossed?<br />
2:47:22 PM mlemay yea<br />
2:47:24 PM mlemay sure<br />
2:47:28 PM mlemay will do that<br />
2:47:39 PM mlemay we can refine all that in our detailed design meetings<br />
2:47:43 PM mlemay if you are ok with that<br />
2:47:53 PM mlemay I just want ot present the need for the &quot;service&quot;<br />
2:48:14 PM mlemay then we can discuss interfaces / datamodels and whatnot<br />
2:48:47 PM phudgins agreed<br />
2:49:00 PM mlemay perfect thanks alot for your support Paul<br />
2:49:03 PM mlemay really appreciated<br />
2:49:20 PM mlemay do you want to schedule a work sessions in the upcoming days<br />
2:49:29 PM mlemay or weeks<br />
2:49:38 PM phudgins always good to not be going alone<br />
2:50:04 PM phudgins yes - next couple of days would be good<br />
2:52:41 PM mlemay perfecet<br />
2:53:08 PM mlemay Please review wiki page and make changes you want<br />
2:53:25 PM phudgins will do<br />
2:53:38 PM mlemay any other item to discuss?<br />
2:56:02 PM phudgins can you post the wiki location here? I can't seem to find a way to naviagte to it from the main<br />
2:56:13 PM mlemay ok 1 sec<br />
2:56:50 PM phudgins found it - #link https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Project_Proposals:Dynamic_Resource_Reservation<br />
2:56:58 PM mlemay https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Project_Proposals:Dynamic_Resource_Reservation<br />
2:57:56 PM phudgins my only other concern is whether having multi-layer and reservation combined may be considered too much for one project?<br />
3:01:39 PM mlemay hard to seperate<br />
3:01:56 PM mlemay we'll do it in 2 phases<br />
3:01:58 PM mlemay (IMO)<br />
3:02:25 PM mlemay they might want to get it split but hard to allocate resource dynamically if no multilayer routing<br />
3:02:41 PM mlemay from my experience<br />
3:03:05 PM phudgins easy to separate into two projects - but certainly the reservation system will depend on the multi-layer support<br />
3:03:07 PM mlemay resource reservation and multilayer routing are linked<br />
3:03:22 PM mlemay vice versa<br />
3:03:54 PM mlemay multilayer depends on resource availability in a given point in time<br />
3:04:00 PM mlemay (routing)<br />
3:05:39 PM phudgins I was separating the work of modeling mutli-layer aspects from the temporal aspects of reservation<br />
3:05:52 PM mlemay yes<br />
3:06:01 PM mlemay I agree but there is codependency<br />
3:06:13 PM mlemay for end to end solution<br />
3:06:20 PM mlemay but they are different work items<br />
3:06:22 PM mlemay but coupled<br />
3:07:03 PM mlemay go ahead and make changes :)<br />
3:07:09 PM phudgins we are probably good to go then<br />
3:08:04 PM mlemay perfect fhanks for everything I,ll follow up<br />
3:08:10 PM mlemay based off tomorrow's feedback<br />
3:08:29 PM phudgins ok - I'll be there<br />
3:08:42 PM mlemay thank I'll adjourn meeting if nothing else
