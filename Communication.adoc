== Communication Channels

Communication is part of the lifeblood of any open source project and
there are several different ways we communicate in OpenDaylight.

There are two main channels of communication for OpenDaylight:

1.  IRC - The first and possibly the most useful to many folks
2.  https://lists.opendaylight.org[mailing lists]. - You will find a
large number of lists available but we're also working on reducing the
number and merging lists.

[[mailing-list-topics]]
=== Mailing list Topics

The merge of lists is done via the built in
http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/mailman-member/node29.html[topics]
feature of http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/index.html[GNU Mailman].

The following lists have topics applied to them:

* https://lists.opendaylight.org/mailman/listinfo/bugs[bugs] - automated
list
* https://lists.opendaylight.org/mailman/listinfo/dev[dev] - Project
based development
* https://lists.opendaylight.org/mailman/listinfo/discuss[discuss] -
Most active list
* https://lists.opendaylight.org/mailman/listinfo/jenkins[jenkins] -
automated list

The following projects do not have dedicated mailing lists in the same
fashion that older projects do as such, they utilize mailing lists
topics as the only way of segregating their list traffic:

* Project_Proposals:Documentation[ Documentation] - There is a dedicated
https://lists.opendaylight.org/mailman/listinfo/documentation[list] for
this project but it isn't named following most of the list naming
conventions.
* Project_Proposals:Dynamic_Resource_Reservation[ Dynamic Resource
Reservation]
* OpenDaylight_Tookit:Main[ OpenDaylight Toolkit]
* PacketCablePCMM:Main[ PacketCable PCMM]

By default when you join one of those lists you will receive *all*
topics.

To only receive the topics which you want you will need to log into your
management interface for the given list. If you did not specifically set
a password when you joined the list one will have been created and
mailed to you. By default it is resent on the first day of each month.
You may access the subscription management interface by going to the
subscription page for the given list and entering the email address that
you subscribed with into the very bottom entry box on the page next to
the button entitled *Unsubscribe or edit options*.

On the next page enter your list specific password and press the *Log
in* button.

Scroll down to the section which asks the question *Which topic
categories would you like to subscribe to?* and select the topics that
you want to monitor. You probably also want to set the following
question *Do you want to receive messages that do not match any topic
filter?* to *Yes* (at least until you know for certain that you don't
want non-topic mail).

Scroll down and press the *Submit my changes* button.

[[gerrit-mail]]
=== Gerrit mail

With the attempt to decrease and combine our mailing lists comes the
fact that new projects do not get https://git.opendaylight.org[Gerrit
(git)] lists.

Please see Communication:Gerrit[ Gerrit change mail] page for
information on how to receive mail from Gerrit.
