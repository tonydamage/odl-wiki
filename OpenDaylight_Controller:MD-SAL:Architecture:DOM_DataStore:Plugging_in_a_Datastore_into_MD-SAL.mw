A Data Store can be plugged into the MD-SAL in two ways:
* Implement the SAL Core SPI and use functionality (e.g. transactions) of the existing DOM Data Broker implementation.
* Implement the SAL Core API and replace the existing DOM Data Broker with its own, Data Store specific implementation.


The SAL Core SPI and SAL Core API are shown in the following figure:
