==  Installation == 
 Important Note: File names differs for all the latest virtualization edition and Hydrogen Relase version.
 So please ensure before running the commands, when following the installation procedure as below.
=== Installing ODL Controller and Execution ===
:1.Unzip the downloaded file as follows 
 unzip distributions-virtualization-0.1.0-osgipackage.zip
:2. This will create a directory with name opendaylight
:3. Please ensure the environment variable JAVA_HOME is set to the location of the JDK.
:4. Execute Controller for VTN using the below command
  * cd opendaylight
  * ./run.sh -virt vtn
:5. The Controller will be up and running with the components required for VTN virtualization.

=== Installing the VTN Coordinator ===
:1. The VTN Coordinator is available in the externalapps of the virtualization edition
:2. Install the VTN Coordinator using the command
:* cd opendaylight/externalapps
:* tar –C / -jxvf org.opendaylight.vtn.distribution.vtn-coordinator-5.0.0.0-bin.tar.bz2
:3. This will install the Coordinator to /usr/local/vtn directory.
:4. If the VTN Coordinator need to be run on a different machine, Copy the org.opendaylight.vtn.distribution.vtn-coordinator-5.0.0.0-bin.tar.bz2 and uncompress.

=== Launch the VTN Coordinator ===
==== Prior Preparation ====
===== Install additional applications required for VTN Coordinator =====
:* yum install perl-Digest-SHA uuid libxslt libcurl unixODBC
:* wget <nowiki>http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm</nowiki>
:* rpm -Uvh epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
:* yum install json-c

=====  Installing PostgreSQL Database =====
:: The following steps to be followed to have PostgreSQL installed for Hydrogen release
   
   Configure Yum repository to download the latest rpms for PostgreSQL 9.1
   rpm -ivh http://yum.postgresql.org/9.1/redhat/rhel-6-x86_64/pgdg-redhat91-9.1-5.noarch.rpm
   

   Install the required PostgreSQL packages
   yum install postgresql91-libs postgresql91 postgresql91-server postgresql91-contrib postgresql91-odbc

* Note: if you are facing any problems while installing postgreSQL rpm, Please refer to [[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Installation:Troubleshooting#Problems_while_Installing_PostgreSQL_due_to_openssl|openssl_problems]] query in troubleshooting FAQ.

===== Install and Configure tomcat =====
Please use any one of the below procedure
;* Configuration via script 
Follow the below link,

https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_%28VTN%29:Main/Tomcat_configuration
	
To run the script:
	
: sh Tomcat_setup.sh
 Notes:
* Run the script as a sudo user
* If the VTN Coordinator and the controller are  deployed in the same server, then make sure, when the setup script asks you, to set the port from 8080 to some 
other number as available in the server (8080 is the port used by ODL). This will be the last step in the script and the question will be "Need to change connector port, Enter[Y/N]".

;* Manual Configuration
:1. Install Tomcat.
:* Download the following file.
:** http://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-7/v7.0.39/bin/apache-tomcat-7.0.39.tar.gz
:* Extract under /usr/share/java.
 tar zxvf apache-tomcat-7.0.39.tar.gz -C /usr/share/java

:2. Carry out Tomcat settings.
:* Create the following symbolic link.
 ln -s /usr/local/vtn/tomcat/webapps/vtn-webapi /usr/share/java/apache-tomcat-7.0.39/webapps/vtn-webapi
:* Add the following to common.loader of /usr/share/java/apache-tomcat-7.0.39/conf/catalina.properties.
 /usr/local/vtn/tomcat/lib,/usr/local/vtn/tomcat/lib/*.jar
:* Add the following to shared.loader of /usr/share/java/apache-tomcat-7.0.39/conf/catalina.properties.
 /usr/local/vtn/tomcat/shared/lib/*.jar
:* Add the following to <Server> of /usr/share/java/apache-tomcat-7.0.39/conf/server.xml.
 <Listener className="org.opendaylight.vtn.tomcat.server.StateListener" />

:3. If the VTN Coordinator and the controller are  deployed in the same server, then change the apache port from 8080 to some 
other number as available in the server. 8080 is the port used by the ODL. The ports need to be modified in the server.xml of the tomcat installation.

===== Configure Database for VTN Coordinator =====
 /usr/local/vtn/sbin/db_setup

===== Launch VTN Coordinator to accept requests =====
:* /usr/local/vtn/bin/vtn_start
:* Launch tomcat to accept requests (Not necessary to run the below command if downloaded latest virtualization edition)
   /usr/share/java/apache-tomcat-7.0.39/bin/catalina.sh start

===== Test and use VTN Coordinator =====

:*;Important Note
 If installed "Hydrogen Release" version, VTN Coordinator runs on port 8080 by default.
 If installed "latest virtualization edition" version, VTN Coordinator runs on port 8083 by default.
 So, please ensure the port number on which VTN coordinator is running and execute the following commands.

:1. The below command should yield such a response to ensure successful installation
   curl -X GET -H 'content-type: application/json' -H 'username: admin' -H 'password: adminpass' \
   -H 'ipaddr:127.0.0.1' <nowiki>http://<VTN_COORDINATOR_IP_ADDRESS>:8080/vtn-webapi/api_version.json</nowiki>
:Response   
   {"api_version":{"version":"V1.0"}}

:2. Create and use VTN
Please refer to [[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):VTN_Coordinator:RestApi#VTNCoordinator_RestApi_Contents|Web API reference]] for all the API details to create VTN and all its sub components.
