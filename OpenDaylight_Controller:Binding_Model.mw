==Binding Model Subsystems==
The Binding Model is a specification that describes how a YANG schema and the Binding-independent Data Format are translated into generated bindings (statically-typed Java Interfaces, DTOs, builders and mappers).
The Binding Model has two subsystems:
* Consumer & Provider binding  – A subset of the binding model which is directly visible to Consumers and Providers; it  uses binding at the development (compile) time. This subset consists of Generated Java Interfaces for:
** Data Transfer Objects
** DTO Builders
** RPC Interfaces
* Binding Infrastructure components – Infrastructure components are not directly visible to the Consumers and Providers. They are responsible for the implementation of the binding functionality and/or generated Java interfaces. Infrastructure components are only available at runtime and are typically dynamically generated. Binding Infrastructure components are specific to the implementation of the Binding-Aware SAL layer.

==Consumer & Provider Binding==
The Consumer & Provider Binding is generated from YANG schema.

===Data Transfer Objects===
Data Transfer Objects represent the instances of data nodes  defined by YANG Schema and are used to store and transfer data. Data Transfer Objects are immutable and are represented as interfaces in generated compile-time binding (the implementation is supplied in runtime by use of the builders).

===DTO Builders===
DTO Builders are objects that create DTOs. The builders are represented as interfaces in generated binding compile-time bindingsl The implementation of builders can be obtained at runtime via Factory methods provided by the Binding-Aware Broker and the Binding Generator.

===RPC Interfaces===
RPC interfaces represent the programmatic API to invoking RPCs provided by Providers. The RPC interfaces describe all the RPCs available in a YANG module in the form of methods.
The implementation of RPC interface depends on type of component that uses the binding:
* Consumer – Proxy of an RPC interface is provided at runtime; the  proxy uses the Binding-Aware Broker functionality to invoke the right RPC implementation.
* Provider – implementation of an RPC interface is provided by the Provider. The Provider’s developer is responsible for creating the implementation of the RPC interface and implementing the functionality as described in the model. The generated RPC interface serves as a contract / skeleton for the implementation. In order to expose the implementation, this implementation must be registered in the Binding-Aware Broker.
