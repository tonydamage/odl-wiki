Eclipse is a framework for building, deploying and managing software across the software lifecycle. 

Go to the [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/  Eclipse Website] and download Eclipse Java Developers Edition if you haven't already. The Developers Edition version comes with all the Git tools, which is not included in the Classic version.
