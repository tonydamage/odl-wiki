=OpenFlow  Protocol Library: Insights=

==Architecture and Design==
===Key objectives=== 
* Simultaneous support of multiple versions of wire-protocol 
* Extensibility to support later OpenFlow versions 
* Immutable transfer objects generation 
* Scalable non-blocking implementation 
* Pipeline processing 
* Scatter buffer 
* TLS support 

===Common principles===

* Serialization (message coding / decoding) logic is separated from implementation of transfer objects.

* All transfer objects returned from this library are immutable.

* Input/Output processing is done via processing pipeline, which could be modified in runtime based on session characteristics (e.g. support of multiple binary protocol versions).
