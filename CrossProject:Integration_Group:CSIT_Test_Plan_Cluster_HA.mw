==Prerequisites==
* Start Opendaylight Controller Cluster with minimum 2 Controllers using ''./run.sh -Dsupernodes=Controller1_IP:Controller2_IP -start''
* Start mininet (i.e. ''mininet> sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=Controller1_IP --topo tree,2'')
** This generates 3 nodes: SW1 (*:01), SW2 (*:02), SW3 (*:03)
** SW1 has 2 ports: 1,2 that connects to SW2 and SW3
** SW2 has 3 ports: 1 to host1 (10.0.0.1), 2 to host2 (10.0.0.2) and 3 to SW1
** SW3 has 3 ports: 1 to host3 (10.0.0.3), 2 to host4 (10.0.0.4) and 3 to SW1
