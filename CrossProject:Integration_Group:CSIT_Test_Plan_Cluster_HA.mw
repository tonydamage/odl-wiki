==Prerequisites==
* Make sure you meet the requirement documented [https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Controller:Clustering:HowTo here] before starting the cluster.
* Start a cluster of Opendaylight controllers with minimum 2 controllers:
** In the first controller machine do ''./run.sh -Dsupernodes=Controller1_IP:Controller2_IP -start''  with administrator priviledges
*** This will start Controller1 in a cluster as supernode
* In the second controller machine do ''./run.sh -Dsupernodes=Controller1_IP:Controller2_IP -start''  with administrator priviledges
*** This will start Controller2 in a cluster as supernode
* Start mininet (i.e. ''mininet> sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=Controller1_IP --topo tree,2'')
** This generates 3 nodes: s1 (*:01), s2 (*:02), s3 (*:03)
** At this point only the Controller1 get provisioned in OVS bridges (s1, s2, s3)
** s1 has 2 ports: 1,2 that connects to s2 and s3
** s2 has 3 ports: 1 to host1 (10.0.0.1), 2 to host2 (10.0.0.2) and 3 to s1
** s3 has 3 ports: 1 to host3 (10.0.0.3), 2 to host4 (10.0.0.4) and 3 to s1
* Now, puase the mininet (i.e. ''mininet> CTRL + Z'')
* In order to get Controller2 provisioned in OVS bridge ''s1'' do the following commands with administrator priviledges:
** ''$ ovs-vsctl set-controller s1 tcp:Controller1_IP:6633 tcp:Controller2_IP:6633''
** Do the very same command for ''s2'' and ''s3''
