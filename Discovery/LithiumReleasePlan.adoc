[[expected-dependencies-on-other-projects]]
== Expected Dependencies on Other Projects

This project may end up being merged with the DIDM project

[[compatibility-with-previous-releases]]
== Compatibility with Previous Releases

Discovery has not had an official release, but this release should see
some significant changes, and thus any project depending on the current
version will experience compatibility issues.

[[themes-and-priorities]]
== Themes and Priorities

The theme of this release will be moving from a notification based flow
to a model driven flow, which should be more in line with ODL design
points.
