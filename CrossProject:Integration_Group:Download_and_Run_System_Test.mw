== Introduction ==
The purpose of this wiki is to describe how to download and run the System Test code. 

== Requirements ==

This instruction requires a System Test environment so please visit [[CrossProject:Integration_Group:Create_System_Test_Environment|Create System Test Environment]] wiki if you do not have it yet.

== Download System Test Code ==

Get latest integration code:
<pre>
odluser@odl-vm:~\> git clone https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/integration
</pre>

Navigate to system test suites folder:
<pre>
odluser@odl-vm:~\> cd integration/test/csit/suites
</pre>

System test suites are organized in 2 level folder structure: 

* First level folder is the main suite for a given distribution like Base, VTN, Service Provider or Base edition with -of13 option
* Second level folder is for the sub-suites that run within the main suite: AD-SAL NSF, AD-SAL Apps, MD-SAL NSF, OVSDB, VTN, etc...

== Running System Test Code ==

=== Start Controller ===

Before starting system test, make sure controller is running. Please visit [[CrossProject:Integration_Group:Controller_Artifacts|Controller Artifacts]] wiki to get more help on how to install and run controller.

=== Executing System Test ===

Robot framework is used to write and execute system test, so we just need to execute pybot command with following arguments:

* CONTROLLER: Controller IP address
* MININET: Mininet IP address
* USER_HOME: Robot user home path (for ssh authentication)
* MININET_USER: Mininet User (for ssh authentication)
* Suite path: suite to be executed

=== Examples ===

Run system test for base edition with new plugin (default) when controller and mininet are in the same VM:
<pre>
odluser@odl-vm:~\> pybot -v CONTROLLER:127.0.0.1 -v MININET:127.0.0.1 -v USER_HOME:$HOME -v MININET_USER:$USER $HOME/integration/test/csit/suites/base-of13/
</pre>

Run system test for base edition old plugin (-of10) AD-SAL NSF when controller and mininet are on different VM:
<pre>
odluser@odl-vm:~\> pybot -v CONTROLLER:192.168.1.1 -v MININET:192.168.1.2 -v USER_HOME:$HOME -v MININET_USER:$USER $HOME/integration/test/csit/suites/base-of10/010__AD_SAL_NSF
</pre>

'''IMPORTANT''': In case of different VMs for controller and mininet, you have to use interface IPs instead of loopback IPs like example above
