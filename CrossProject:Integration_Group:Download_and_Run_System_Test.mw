== Introduction ==
The purpose of this wiki is to describe how to download and run the System Test code. 

== Requirements ==

This instruction requires a System Test environment so please visit [https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/CrossProject:Integration_Group:Create_System_Test_Environment Create System Test Environment] wiki if you do not have it yet.

== Download System Test Code ==

Get latest integration code:
<pre>
odluser@odl-vm:~\> git clone https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/integration
</pre>

Browse system test suites folder:
<pre>
odluser@odl-vm:~\> cd integration/test/csit/suites
</pre>

=== Test repository Structure ===

System test suites are organized in 2 level folder structure: 

* First level folder is the main suite for a given distribution like Base, VTN, Service Provider or Base edition with -of13 option
* Second level folder is for the sub-suites that run within the main suite: AD-SAL NSF, AD-SAL Apps, MD-SAL NSF, OVSDB, VTN, etc...


== Running System Test Code ==

Run system with following command:
<pre>
odluser@odl-vm:~\> pybot -v CONTROLLER:127.0.0.1 -v MININET:127.0.0.1 -v USER_HOME:${HOME} -v MININET_USER:${USER} ${HOME}/integration/test/csit/suites/base/
</pre>
'''IMPORTANT''': In case you have a split setup (different VMs for controller and mininet), you have to use interface IPs instead of loopbacks for the controller and mininet
