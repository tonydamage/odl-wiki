== Introduction ==
The purpose of this wiki is to describe how to download and run the System Test code. 

== Requirements ==

This instruction requires a System Test environment so please visit [https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/CrossProject:Integration_Group:Create_System_Test_Environment Create System Test Environment] wiki if you do not have it.

=== Download and Run System Test Code ===

Download latest integration code:
<pre>
odluser@odl-vm:~\> git clone https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/integration
</pre>

Run system with following command:
<pre>
odluser@odl-vm:~\> pybot -v CONTROLLER:127.0.0.1 -v MININET:127.0.0.1 -v USER_HOME:${HOME} -v MININET_USER:${USER} ${HOME}/integration/test/csit/suites/base/
</pre>
'''IMPORTANT''': In case you have a split setup (different VMs for controller and mininet), you have to use interface IPs instead of loopbacks for the controller and mininet
