[[purpose]]
== Purpose

A common definition of the interface to a SDN controller must be defined
in order that companies can correctly plan and architect solutions that
work across SDN providers. This interface should be such that it
correctly scopes the behavior of an SDN controller to a common industry
understanding and thus also prevents a SDN controller from increasing
scope to that of a management system or beyond.

By having a common SDN interface vendors can build added value
capability on top of an SDN controller with the knowledge that their
development effort can be used independent of the SDN controller a given
customer chooses to deploy. Additionally, by defining the boundary of a
SDN controller (planning and realization) the industry can start to
understand and evolve how cooperating systems, such as network
management and SDN, work to provide customer value.

[[proposal]]
== Proposal

The proposed SDN interface leverages the concept of a graph to allow a
client to define the desired connectivity and constraints for a request.
The graph request is sparse and only contains those nodes and
constraints that are relevant to the request. As an example, consider
the symbolic network graph in Figure 1. In this diagram, each vertex in
the graph represents a network element and each edge represents a
network connection. Sample SDN graph requests are :

* Figure 2 depicts a request of connectivity where the the adjacency
between the two end points must traverse through a middle point (red
vertex).
* Figure 3 depicts a request for hub and spoke adjacencies
* Figure 4 depicts a request for a ring adjacencies

Each of these requests would be specified as a set or vertices and edges
along with constraints and passed to a SDN system as a request. A sample
request is at the end of this document.

[[planning-and-realization]]
=== Planning and Realization

::
  While the main thrust of this proposal pertains to the SDN interface,
  as a consequence of this interface it is also proposed that a SDN
  controller be conceptualized as at least two components. The first,
  planning, is responsible for dealing with requests in terms of loose
  adjacencies as well as incorporating business level concepts such as
  reservations and priority; where the second component, realization, is
  responsible for "current time" requests as well as multiplexing to
  multiple network element. More information is in the section labeled
  "SDN Controller Interface" below.

[[time-element-reservations]]
=== Time Element / Reservations

::
  The element of time and reservations is important to a SDN controller,
  particularly the planing portion of the system. It is proposed that
  time based aspects of a SDN controller are maintained within the
  planning component of the SDN controller and not at the realization
  component. Thus it is the responsibility of the planner to understand
  and manage resource contention along a time line where the realization
  will only manage resource contention at the time of a request.

[[responsibility-of-the-sdn-controller]]
== Responsibility of the SDN Controller

The purpose of the SDN controller is to accept multiple requests and
based on the state of the network elements under its control, previous
requests and any reservations; it should transition the state of the
network elements to meet the request (if possible) or reject the
request, if not possible. How the SDN controller calculates paths,
optimizes the network, and to some extent applies constraints /
policies, is left up to the implementation. It is possible that
different implementations support different constraint sets, as such it
should be possible to query a SDN controller for the constraints that it
supports.

[[ask]]
== Ask

The "ask" fro this document is somewhat vague. The main purpose of the
document and thus the ask, is to get general agreement / acceptance of
the ideas presented in the document. Given that general agreement can be
reached some actions may follow, such as:

* implementation of the tight adjacency interface
* implementation of the loose adjacency interface
* performance test suite based on the interfaces

[[queries]]
== Queries

(All query results must be filtered based on authorization)

It should be possible to query the controller for the graph requests
that it has in its inventory as well as information as to how those
graph requests map from loose adjacencies to tight adjacencies and are
realized on the physical network, including all logical layers on top of
the physical network, and all network layers (i.e. L3 to L0). This
mapping may be system implementation dependent, in that different
implementations may represent this mapping in different ways. (it would
be nice to have a standard, but if we could agree on the request that
would be a first step).

It should be possible to query the policies defined in the system (the
API to add policies is left to the imagination of the reader, but i
suspect it looks RESTful as policies are resources)

[[multiple-autonomous-controllers]]
== Multiple Autonomous Controllers

In the situation where a single SDN controller is not responsible for an
entire network graph, controllers can be configured to have areas of
responsibility. In this scenario any controller can view the areas of
the network to which they are connected, but not in control, as a "black
box". Thus when calculating a path a given controller can calculate and
provision that in which they are in control and hand off "subgraphs" to
other controllers that are responsible for the other areas. In this way
controllers can be deployed hierarchical or as a peering mesh, i.e.
various deployment implementations can be utilized. When managing a
network change across domains of control the concept of a transaction
would likely be required where by policies such as best effort or all or
nothing can be implemented.

[[conceptual-block-diagram]]
== Conceptual Block Diagram

As described above the SDN controller interface is responsible to
handling a request of loose adjacencies and compiling or render that
graph to a specific or tight adjacencies. The method of performing this
transformation is left to the implementations, but from a general
perspective this transformation would include such operations as path
computation (PCE) and network optimization. This transformation would
also have to support this transformation in the context of both a
multiple layer physical network as well as logical network overlays.

[cols=",",]
|=======================================================================
|image:Block.png[Figure 5 - Illustrative System Block
Diagram,title="fig:Figure 5 - Illustrative System Block Diagram"] a|
Figure 5 illustrates the basic structure of the SDN system in that it
depicts how the planning component of the SDN controller processes the
loose adjacency request, eventually rendering it down to a tight
adjacency graph request. Important in this illustration is that if the
planner implementation performs optimization or other cross request,
network wide operations on the more abstract graph the more flexibility
the implementation will have in terms of rendering down to tight
adjacencies.

Additionally this block diagram highlights the possibility of separation
between the planning component of the SDN controller and the realization
component (dotted line). While this separation is not a requirement it
does provide for the possibility of implementations being compliant with
the either the loose adjacency interface or the tight adjacency
interface as well as the possibility of planning components to leverage
different implementations of the tight adjacency interface.

_Note: This diagram and explanation is only illustrative and not meant
to imply implementation or architectural decisions. The point of this
document is to work towards agreement on the broad idea of a planning
and realization component of a SDN controller and the interfaces to
those components._

|=======================================================================

[[sdn-controller-interface]]
== SDN Controller Interface

Up to this point the focus has been on the loose adjacency interface. A
distinction can be made in a SDN controller that there is a planner
component and a realization component. The suggestion by this
distinction is that what has been described as the loose adjacency graph
request is really the interface to the SDN planner and that the SDN
planner's interface can be viewed as the highest level interface to a
SDN controller. The SDN realization interface, by extension, is a lower
level interface and will be defined here as an interface that allows an
external client, such as the SDN planner, to describe well defined,
tight (i.e. not loose) adjacencies and the parameters to those
adjacencies. It is the responsibility of the realization component to
protect from resource contention in current time‡‡ and to multiplex a
single request to multiple network elements under its control.

Figures 6 and 7 (below) attempt to illustrate how a SDN, loose adjacency
request might be transformed into a SDN, tight adjacency request that
would be fulfilled by a SDN realization component. Figure 7 does not
contain the complete detail of the tight adjacency request as this
request would include directives that ensure that forwarding would be
realized based on the higher level request, i.e. in a ring scheme, as
well as it does depict aspects such as layer transformations.

It may be noted that the tight adjacency request that is consumed by a
realizer can be viewed as just a more detailed version of the graph
request that is consumed by the SDN planner, thus a common syntax might
be leveraged to simply communication as well as documentation.

[[resource-contention]]
=== Resource Contention

::
  As mentioned above, it is the responsibility of the SDN realizer to
  manage resource contention of the requests it processes. Contention
  should be managed not only at the SDN realization level, but at the
  planning level as well; still the realization component requires some
  level of contention protection. The contention protection at the
  realization level will be scoped to that of contention across tight
  adjacency graphs, where each of these graphs will be identified by a
  unique ID, thus they can be created, manipulated, and deleted as
  entities. The rule would be that two graphs cannot utilize the same
  resource except where policy permits, such as over subscription or
  path protection with non-complete diversity.

‡‡ What is meant by "resource contention in current time" is that the
component implementing the tight adjacency interface only protects from
resource contention for current requests and does not provide for
resource contention that utilizes time based reservations. Time based
resource contention protection would be managed by the planning
component.

[[path-protection]]
=== Path Protection

Path protection is an important aspect of modern controlled networks.
Protection can be implemented in various way, but it is important from
the perspective of the SDN interface to allow protection to be specified
in the abstract such that the controller has the optimum flexibility to
determine how protection is realized in the network. For this interface
protection will be specified as a constraint on the request where the
constraint can be expressed against the whole request or against
specific edges in the request.

Protection constraint specification must include not only the type of
protection (e.g., 1+1, 1:1) but also characteristics of the protection
such as diversity and fail-over latency.

In the proposed interface model hosts are modeled as any other network

[[resources]]
== Resources

The following is meant to be an example of the RESTful requests possible
against a system as described above. It is not meant to be the
definitive listing of operations, but is instead meant to characterize
the interactions between a client and and SDN system.

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Operation |Resource |Description
|POST |/requests |The request was accepted and a record of the request
now exists. The POST operation will return a location header that
references the /requests/\{id} from which the request, its status, and
any other runtime information can be queried. Still up for debate is if
the status and runtime information should be available within the
request structure or as a separate resources.

|PUT |/reqeusts/\{id} |TBD - Can a request be modified or is this really
a new request?

|GET |/requests |Returns the list of all requests in the system. This
URL should accept filter and paging capabilities

|GET |/requests/\{id} |Returns a single request

|DELETE |/requests/\{id} |Deletes a single request, if this request has
been processed into the network, this will remove that configuration
from the network

|POST |/policies |The policy was accepted and a record of the request
now exists. This new policy will be applied against all existing
requests in the system and thus can effect the realization of the
requests on the network

|PUT |/policies/\{id} |The policy was updated to the information in the
PUT. This is a replacement operation, not a merge. The updated policy
will be applied against all existing requests in the system and thus can
effect the realization of the requests on the network

|GET |/policies/\{id} |Returns a single policy

|DELETE |/policies/\{id} |Deletes a single policy. The removal of this
policy will be applied against all existing requests in the system and
thus can effect the realization of the request on the network.
|=======================================================================

† Note: requests and policies will be augmented with a value such as
'enabled' that can have a boolean value of 'true' or 'false' such that
requests or policies can be deactivated without removing them from the
system.

[[notes-on-the-request]]
== Notes on the Request

Below is an example of a SDN request. It is essentially a structure that
represents the graph, its constraints, and the policies to be applied.
While this representation is in JSON notation, the the request could be
encoded in other forms such as XML. One important aspect of this
structure, regardless of encoding, is that in several places a value can
be either a single primitive type or it can be structure that is
essentially a preferred value and constraints that define other
acceptable values if the preferred value can not be met. An example of
this is the *bandwidth* constraint. In one edge the value is *3Gpbs* in
another it is a sub-structure with a 'desired' value and an acceptable
*range*.
