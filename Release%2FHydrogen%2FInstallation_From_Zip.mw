'''Prerequisites:'''
{{:Release/Hydrogen/Java Notes}}
* ''Are there others? Python?''

'''Understanding The Structure:'''
* The main content of OpenDaylight Hydrogen is in a directory called ''opendaylight'', where you will see the following files:
**''run.sh'' — launches OpenDaylight on Linux/Mac/Unix systems
**''run.bat'' — launches OpenDaylight on Windows systems
**''version.properties'' — indicates the build version
**''configuration'' — basic initialization files (internal to OpenDaylight)
**''lib'' — Java libraries
**''plugins'' — OpenDaylight's OSGi plugins

'''Running OpenDaylight:'''
# Enter ''./run.sh'' or ''./run.bat'' with administrator privileges to launch OpenDaylight.
# Navigate to ''<nowiki>http://<ip-address-of-machine-where-you-ran-opendaylight>:8080</nowiki>'' to open the web interface, then use the following credentials to log in:
#* User: admin
#* Password: admin
# If you are running OpenDaylight on the same machine as your browser, you can browse to ''<nowiki>http://localhost:8080</nowiki>'' or ''<nowiki>http://127.0.0.1:8080</nowiki>'' to avoid needing to know the IP address of the machine you are using.
