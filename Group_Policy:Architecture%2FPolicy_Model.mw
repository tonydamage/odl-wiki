<onlyinclude>
The policy model is built around the idea of placing endpoints into groups that share the same semantics, and then defining what other groups those endpoints need to communicate, and then finally defining how these endpoints need to communicate.  In this way, we represent the requirements of the application and then force the infrastructure to figure out how to meet these requirements, rather than defining the policy in terms of the underlying infrastructure.

== Policy Concepts ==
This section describes some of the most important concepts in the policy model.  This is not intended to be necessarily a complete list, but enough to understand the major players.  See the next section on [[Group Policy:Architecture/Policy Model#Policy Resolution|Policy Resolution]] for a description of how these fit together to determine how to apply the policy to the network.

; Endpoint
: An ''endpoint'' is a specific device in the network.  It could be a VM interface, a physical interface, or other network device.  Endpoints are defined and assigned to endpoint groups though mechanisms that are not specified by the policy model (See [[Group Policy:Architecture/Endpoint Registry|Endpoint Registry]] for more information).  Endpoints can have associated ''conditions'' that are just ''labels'' that represent some potentially-transient status information about an endpoint.
; Endpoint Group
: ''Endpoint groups'' are sets of endpoints that share a common set of policies.  Endpoint groups have ''contract selectors'' that choose in which ''contracts'' the endpoint group should participate.  They also expose both ''requirements'' and ''capabilities'', which are ''labels'' that help to determine how contracts will be applied.
; Contract
: ''Contracts'' determine which endpoints can communicate and in what way.  Contracts between pairs of endpoint groups are selected by the contract selectors defined by the endpoint group.  Contracts expose ''qualities'' that can be used by the contract selectors to select qualities.  Once the contract is selected, contracts have clauses that can match against requirements and capabilities exposed by endpoint groups, as well as any conditions that may be set on endpoints.
; Label
: ''Labels'' are names or tags that represent some meaningful piece of information useful for determining how the policy should be applied.  There are four kinds of label: requirements and capabilities for endpoint groups, conditions for endpoints, and qualities for contracts.
; Clause
: ''Clauses'' are defined as part of a ''contract''.  ''Clauses'' determine how a contract should be applied to particular endpoints and ''endpoint groups''.  ''Clauses'' can match against ''requirements'' and ''capabilities'' exposed by endpoint groups, as well as any ''conditions'' that may be set on endpoints.  Matching clauses define some set of ''subjects'' which can be applied to the communication between the pairs of endpoints.
; Subject
: ''Subjects'' describe some aspect of how two endpoints are allowed to communicate.  Subjects define an ordered list of rules that will match against the traffic to perform any necessary actions on that traffic.  No communication is allowed unless a subject allows that communication.
; Contract Selector
: Endpoint groups can use ''contract selectors'' to select contracts that can apply to the communication between the two groups.
