[[install-and-run-opendaylight]]
== Install and run OpenDaylight:

* Download from
https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/controller/job/controller-daily/lastSuccessfulBuild/
or https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/controller/job/controller-daily/94/
* Unzip distribution.opendaylight-osgipackage.zip
* Start a command window and run:
** cd opendaylight
** run.bat
* This will start the OSGi environment and load up all the plugins
required to run OpenDaylight. It will take a minute or so to get fully
initialized.
* Open a web browser window and navigate to: http://localhost:8080
* Log into OpenDaylight using the credentials:
** Username: admin
** Password: admin
* Once logged in, create a subnet / gateway using the OpenDaylight UI
for 10.0.0.254/24
* Open a new command window (Start | Run | cmd.exe) and run the
following command:
** ipconfig
* Determine your localhost IP address (e.g. 10.0.0.14)
* Execute the following command inside the mininet. Specify the above IP
address in the command below:
** sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=10.0.014,port=6633 --topo tree,2
* This will start a mininet network with a tree topology of level 2 and
connect to the opendaylight controller.
* Inside the mininet shell, execute the following command:
** pingall
* Some of the pings may fail the first time, but if you run pingall
again, all of them should succeed
* Switch back to the web browser and refresh to see the topology created
in mininet

** sudo update-initramfs -u
** sudo reboot
* Login to the VM again after reboot
** sudo -s
