Some initial draft scaling numbers for policy:

* 25K groups (DC case) ??? (NFV case)
* 64 contracts per group
* 16 external classifiers (?) [e.g. L3 contexts] per group
* 200K contracts in aggregate
* 200K members of groups in aggregate
* 5K resolvers (DC case) 250K resolvers (NFV case)

Some rate numbers to consider (and yes, the numbers are meant to imply sub second/sub two second recovery times):

* adding members to groups: 300K/sec
* adding resolvers: 200K/sec
* contract resolution: 70K/sec per resolver
