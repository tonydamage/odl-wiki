Some draft scaling numbers for policy:  Note: these have been split int DC and NFV cases (the NFV case needs more work, but as it is a larger scale, it will be addressed at a later date):

==Data Center (to be honed further)==

* 25K end point groups
* 1K qualities
* 1K requirements
* 1K capabilities
* 1K condition
* 1K subject feature definitions
* 1K tenants
* 64 contracts per group
* 200K end points in aggregate
* 5K resolvers (DC case)

==NFV (needs a lot of work)==
* ??? subject feature definitions
* 100K tenants
* 1024K end point groups
* 250K resolvers (NFV case)
* 10M end points in aggregate

Some NFV rate numbers to consider (and yes, the numbers are meant to imply sub second/sub two second recovery times):

* adding members to groups: 300K/sec
* adding resolvers: 200K/sec
* contract resolution: 70K/sec per resolver
