== Introduction ==

ODL-SDNi App will provide establishment of East-West interface(SDNi communication) between multiple opendaylight controllers.The application will be responsible for sharing and collecting information to/from such federated controller.

Network parameters that would be exchanged as part of SDNi communication:
:::Topology Data:Controller Ip Address,Links,Nodes,Link Bandwidths,MAC Address of switches,Latency,Host IP address
:::QoS Data:Packet Loss rate,Packets Transmitted,Packets Received
This project is dependent on the controller project hence it'll be in offset 1.
