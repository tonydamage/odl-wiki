This page is a place to capture notes on running the Helium release with
mininet.

\1. Download and unzip the latest [Helium] release:

http://www.opendaylight.org/software/downloads

\2. Start karaf:

cd into unzip dir +
bin/karaf +
 3. Install the required features:

feature:install odl-base-all odl-aaa-authn odl-restconf odl-nsf-all
odl-adsal-northbound odl-mdsal-apidocs odl-l2switch-switch odl-dlux-core

\4. Build mininet to ensure we have OpenFlow13 support:

- To use the OpenFlow13 version I downloaded the latest code for mininet
from 08/21/14. Anything later should be fine. +
- There were previous comments that required patching mininet to gain
OpenFlow13 but that was not necessary with the latest code. +
 git clone git://github.com/mininet/mininet +
git checkout -b 2.1.0p1 2.1.0p1 +
sudo ./mininet/util/install.sh -n +
 These were the previous instructions for modifying mininet to support
OpenFlow13: +
 Look in '/opt/mininet/mininet/node.py' for something like "set bridge
%s protocols=%s' % ( self, self.protocols )" +
 After I edit that file I copy it: sudo cp /opt/mininet/mininet/node.py
/opt/mininet/build/lib/mininet/node.py +
 Then build via ./install.sh -n. +
 Probably don't need the cp to the build lib since I think the install
does that but it doesn't hurt.

More details on this step can be obtained here:

and here
https://github.com/dave-tucker/mininet/commit/21323c27347f98fbb416e6310296cea9339fc945

\5. Start mininet: sudo mn --mac --switch=ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow13
--controller=remote,ip=$\{ODL_IP},port=6653 --test pingall - runs a ping
sanity

sudo mn --mac --switch=ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow13
--controller=remote,ip=$\{ODL_IP},port=6653 --topo=tree,3 +
 - creates a three layered topology of 7 switches and two attached
hosts.

*Note 1:* Substitute $\{ODL_IP} with the IP address or where ODL (from
Karaf) is running.

*Note 2:* To in order for the above commands to work under Fedora 20, I
had to first install and start openvswitch with the commands:

sudo yum install openvswitch

sudo systemctl start openvswtich.service

\6. Verify topology in DLUX: +
 http://$\{ODL_IP}:8181/dlux/index.html

If ODL is running on localhost, you can use this:
http://localhost:8181/dlux/index.html

The default user/pass is admin/admin.

At this point you should see the topology in the gui.
