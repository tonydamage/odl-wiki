[[opendaylight-ovsdb-openflow-v1.3-openstack-tutorial-very-advanced]]
== OpenDaylight OVSDB OpenFlow v1.3 OpenStack Tutorial *(Very Advanced)*

This tutorial is not for the feint of heart. Deep understanding of
troubleshooting http://devstack.org[DevStack] knowledge is required as
to merely get OpenStack running prior even to the OVSDB components.

The integration is unique because it uses only native standardized
protocols and is an agentless implementation.

The OpenStack integration architecture uses the following technologies:

* RFC 7047 http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7047/[OVSDB Open vSwitch
Database]
* OpenFlow v1.3
* OpenStack ML2 Plugin

There will be a stable http://openstack.redhat.com/Main_Page[RDO
OpenStack] integration in the next couple of weeks that will be
significantly easier to consume.
