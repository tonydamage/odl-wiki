The User Guide is divided into two primary use case tutorials. Both
assume you have a functioning OVSDB environment that can be found in the
OVSDB:Installation Guide[Installation Guide].

[[ovsdb-mininet-tutorial-using-the-cli-and-rest-api-beginner]]
== OVSDB Mininet Tutorial Using the CLI and REST API (Beginner)

This is a good place to begin understanding the configuration management
aspects of OVSDB. OVSDB_Integration:Mininet_OVSDB_Tutorial[OVSDB Mininet
and Postman Tutorial]

What can be done with this tutorial can be viewed in this demonstration:

[[opendaylight-ovsdb-openflow-v1.3-openstack-tutorial-very-advanced]]
== OpenDaylight OVSDB OpenFlow v1.3 OpenStack Tutorial *(Very Advanced)*

This tutorial is not for the faint of heart. Deep understanding of
troubleshooting http://devstack.org[DevStack] knowledge is required to
merely get OpenStack running prior even to the OVSDB components.

The integration is unique because it uses only native standardized
protocols and is an agentless implementation.

The OpenStack integration architecture uses the following technologies:

* RFC 7047 http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7047/[OVSDB Open vSwitch
Database]
* OpenFlow v1.3
* OpenStack ML2 Plugin

There will be a stable http://openstack.redhat.com/Main_Page[RDO
OpenStack] integration in the near future that will be significantly
easier to consume.
