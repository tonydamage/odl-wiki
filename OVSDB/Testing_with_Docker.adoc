== Steps

sudo docker run -p 6640:6640 --privileged=true -d -i -t
davetucker/docker-ovs:2.1.2 /bin/supervisord -n Assuming you don't have
anything using 6640 on your machine. Syntax is : but in this case you
must use 6640 inside the container as that's the port where it's
listening for connections..

Which would make this:

`       mvn -Dovsdbserver.ipaddress=127.0.0.1 -Dovsdbserver.port=6640 -Pintegrationtest verify`

> > As you can see, using the "docker run" command, we are port
forwarding the docker's instance's 6640 to > the host machine's 6641 &
we are connecting to 6641 to perform the integration test.
