This page discusses the JUnit Test Strategy and test cases for Neutron
Northbound.

[[approach]]
== Approach

Most of the methods within Neutron Northbound data classes are either

1.  simple gettor/settor patterns with logic that can be verified by
simple inspection
2.  extractFields() for extracting a subset of parameters from an
instance of an bject into a new instance of the same object.
3.  toString() for dumping the object instance as part of
logging/debugging

All of the above can be covered via simple system test cases. Therefore,
the first pass of JUnit testing will focus on the other methods in each
class, presenting the planned test cases for each method.

* convert() [IPv4]
1.  Test return of 0 on null argument
2.  Test return value given 32.20.10.0
3.  Test return value given 192.168.2.140
* covert_V6() [IPv6]
1.  Test return of 0 on null argument
2.  Test return value given 2003::1
* contains() [IPv4]
** Allocate pool of size 3
1.  Test against one less than pool bottom
2.  Test against one more than pool bottom
3.  Test against each member of pool
* contains_V6() [IPv6]
** Allocate pool of size 3
1.  Test against one less than pool bottom
2.  Test against one more than pool bottom
3.  Test against each member of pool
* longToIP() [IPv4]
1.  Test return value of convert test 2 to see if 32.20.10.0 is
recovered
2.  Test return value of convert test 3 to see if 192.168.2.140 is
recovered
* bigIntegerToIP [IPv6]
1.  Test return value of convert_V6 test 2 to see if 2003::1 is
recovered
* splitPool() [IPv4]
** Allocate pool of size 5
1.  Test "split" on pool bottom and top (single pool of size 4)
2.  Test split on address above bottom (pool of 1 and pool of 3)
3.  Test split on middle address (2 pools of 2)
4.  Test split on address below top (pool of 3 and pool of 1)
* splitPool_V6() [IPv6]
** Allocate pool of size 5
1.  Test "split" on pool bottom and top (single pool of size 4)
2.  Test split on address above bottom (pool of 1 and pool of 3)
3.  Test split on middle address (2 pools of 2)
4.  Test split on address below top (pool of 3 and pool of 1)

[[neutronsubnet.java]]
=== NeutronSubnet.java

* isValidCIDR()
1.  Test against 10.18.0.0/24 (valid IPv4)
2.  Test against 10.18.0.0/16 (valid IPv4)
3.  Test against 10.18.0.0/8 (not valid IPv4)
4.  Test against 2015:0:0:0:0:0:0:0/24 (valid IPv6)
5.  Test against 2015:0:0:0:0:0:0:1/24 (not valid IPv6)
* gatewayIP_Pool_overlap()
** IPv4
*** create allocation pool of size 5
1.  create subnet with gateway in pool and call (should return true)
2.  create subnet with gateway outside of pool an call (should return
false)
** IPv6
*** repeat above cases using IPv6 addresses
* isValidIP()
** IPv4
*** create subnet
1.  test with address in subnet (should return true)
2.  test with address outside of subnet (should return false)
** IPv6
*** repeat above cases using IPv6 addresses
* isIPInUse()
** IPv4
*** create subnet with partial allocation pool
1.  test gateway address (should return false)
2.  test address in allocation pool (should return false)
3.  test address outside allocation pool (should return true)
4.  test address outside of subnet (should return true)
** IPv6
*** repeat above cases using IPv6 addresses
* getLowAddr()
** IPv4
*** create subnet with multiple allocation pools
1.  call should return lowest address
** IPv6
*** repeat above case using IPv6 addresses
* allocateIP()
** IPv4
*** create subnet with multiple allocation pools
1.  call should return lowest address. After call, check allocation
pools for proper modification
** IPv6
*** repeat above case using IPv6 addresses
* releaseIP()
** IPv4
1.  release address after allocateIP test. Result should be a new
allocation pool with a single address
** IPv6
*** repeat above case using IPv6 addresses
