Adding Neutron data element yang model

'''Neutron APIs provided in Helium are unchanged in Lithium, but have
been moved to the Neutron repo created in Lithium's timeframe. ''' All
projects are expected to stop using the deprecated Neutron API in
controller and begin using org.opendaylight.neutron. More info in this
work is provided
