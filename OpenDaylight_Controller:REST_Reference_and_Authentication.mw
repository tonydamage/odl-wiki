==REST Reference==
You can locate the REST API reference information for each of the modules by navigating to the northbound module directories in your installation. The OpenDaylight Controller REST API contains the following modules. The associated module directory for the API reference content is listed: 

*Topology REST APIs: https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/controller/job/controller-merge/ws/opendaylight/northbound/topology/target/site/wsdocs/index.html
*Host Tracker REST APIs: https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/controller/job/controller-merge/ws/opendaylight/northbound/hosttracker/target/site/wsdocs/index.html
*Flow Programmer REST APIs: https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/controller/job/controller-merge/ws/opendaylight/northbound/flowprogrammer/target/site/wsdocs/index.html
*Static Routing REST APIs: https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/controller/job/controller-merge/ws/opendaylight/northbound/staticrouting/target/site/wsdocs/index.html 
*Statistics REST APIs: https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/controller/job/controller-merge/ws/opendaylight/northbound/statistics/target/site/wsdocs/index.html 
*Subnets REST APIs: https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/controller/job/controller-merge/ws/opendaylight/northbound/subnets/target/site/wsdocs/index.html
*Switch Manager REST APIs: https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/controller/job/controller-merge/ws/opendaylight/northbound/switchmanager/target/site/wsdocs/index.html


In each case you will find the detailed information about the module's REST resources and their verbs (description, URI, parameters, responses, and status codes), schemas, example XML, example JSON, as well as programming examples.

==REST Authentication==
The OpenDaylight Controller provides HTTP Digest authentication for Local users created on the Controller. The Local user creation can only be done via the web graphical user interface and these users can be given authorization to handle one or more slices. The username/password created for an individual user on the web graphical user interface can be used over the REST API to access relevant resources.

HTTPS support is available&nbsp;as of&nbsp;March, 2013, and the controller REST APIs will migrate from HTTP Digest mechanism to HTTP Basic.
