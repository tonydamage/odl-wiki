=Welcome to CrossProject OpenDaylight Security Analysis Page=

== Introduction ==

The OpenDaylight Security analysis team is documenting what security features are present in OpenDaylight  today. In addition, the team will provide recommendations for enhancements of security measures.

That work is being tracked in a google doc  [https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0uv-t-C0LQoYlJWbl9icXR6V2M/edit here].


=== OpenDaylight Apache Karaf Distribution ===

During the April 28, 2014 Tech Work Stream conference call concern was expressed regarding the security footprint deploying ODL into Karaf represents. The following key areas were discussed:
* Karaf's Remote Shutdown Port.
* SSHD default presence.
* Webconsole access.
* External JMX connectivity.
These remote management capabilities are present in Apache Karaf by default, however they can be disable via various configuration alterations. These configuration options may be applied during the construction of the ODL-Karaf distribution. Alternatively, ODL wikidocs may provide guidance and/or links to external documentation to allow users to lock down their deployment post installation. 

Apache Karaf does provide various runtime security features that should become familiar to OpenDaylight developers and administrator. General security documentation at Karaf can be found  [http://karaf.apache.org/manual/latest/users-guide/security.html here]. 

Further security advice can be found in the links below:
* Role based JMX administration is discussed [http://karaf.apache.org/manual/latest/users-guide/monitoring.html here]. 
* Remote SSH access configuration is discussed [http://karaf.apache.org/manual/latest/users-guide/remote.html here]. 
* WebConsole access is discussed [http://karaf.apache.org/manual/latest/users-guide/webconsole.html here].

Disablement of the remote shutdown port can be accomplished via the following:
Set karaf.shutdown.port=-1 in etc/custom.properties or etc/config.properties
