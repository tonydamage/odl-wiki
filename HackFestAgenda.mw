== Ideas ==

* '''VTN Code Walkthrough:'''
* '''Intro to new projects:''' We have quite a few newly proposed projects that people would probably like at least a brief dive into. You can find them on the [[Project Proposals:Main|project proposals page]], but they include.
* [[Project_Proposals:Affinity_Metadata_Service| The Affinity Metadata Service Proposal]] 
* [[Project_Proposals:LispMappingService| The LISP MappingService Proposal]] ([https://wiki.opendaylight.org/images/6/6e/LispMappingService_ProjectProposalSlides.pdf slides])
* [[Project_Proposals:YANG_Tools| YANG Tools]]
* [[Project_Proposals:OpenDefenseFlow| OpenDefenseFlow - An Anti-Dos system]] ([https://wiki.opendaylight.org/images/f/fc/130708_-_OpenDefenseFlow_Proposal_Overview.pdf slides])
* [[Project_Proposals:BGP_and_PCEP| BGP and PCEP Project Proposal]]
* [[Project_Proposals:Openflow_1.3_Protocol_Library| Openflow 1.3 Protocol Library (Java)]]
*  [[Project_Proposals:Open_DOVE| Open DOVE network virtualization platform]]
* [[Project Proposals:OVSDB-Integration| OVSDB Integration]]

== Intro to OpenDaylight ==

Some set of people, hopefully including those who got spun up at the last hackfest, will set up at least a table to walk newcomers through getting code up and working. This should be at least for the <tt>controller</tt> project, but perhaps other projects as well assuming we have code.

== Dixon-Erickson Proposal Blueprint creation ==
Goal: collect owners for each row in [[Dixon-Erickson_OpenDaylight_Merged_Controller_Proposal|DE plan]] and build detailed blueprints

* [[D-E_Proposal:Host_Tracker_Plan|Host Tracker]] plan
** Rob Adamn's gerrit commit [https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/438/]
* Consistent, Replicated Data Store: [https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/controller-dev/2013-May/000537.html discuss mail thread]
* Threading support: [https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/controller-dev/2013-May/000495.html discuss mail thread]

== Deep Dive on Virtual Tenant Networking (VTN) Proposal ==

Goal: Introduce VTN Proposal

Time: 2 hours

# [[Media:NEC VTN Model 0606.pdf|Overview of the VTN Proposal]]
# [[Media:NEC VTN Demo 0606.pdf|Live Demo]]
# [[Media:NEC VTN Implementation 0606.pdf|VTN Implementation]]

== Introduction to OpenDaylight ==

* Some set of people should set up at a table or perhaps a whole corner of a room to provide tutorials and help for one or both code bases to get people up to speed. Ideally, this could be paid forward with people passing along their expertise to those coming later.
* This is a request: Could someone do a deep dive into the controller codebase for people who are relatively new to OpenDaylight codebase?

== Additional topics ==

* Patterns and best practices for integrating non-Java projects into the Open Daylight controller
