== Introduction to OpenDaylight ==

* Some set of people should set up at a table or perhaps a whole corner of a room to provide tutorials and help for one or both code bases to get people up to speed. Ideally, this could be paid forward with people passing along their expertise to those coming later.
* This is a request: Could someone do a deep dive into the controller codebase for people who are relatively new to OpenDaylight codebase?

== Additional topics ==

* Patterns and best practices for integrating non-Java projects into the Open Daylight controller
