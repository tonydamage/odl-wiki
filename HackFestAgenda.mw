== vHackfest ==

We will once again be running a vHackfest for those who cannot attend in person.  This will consist of:
# Ongoing participation on #opendaylight on Freenode IRC
# We will have a very nice video camera hooked up to a LiveStream session. This camera will cover the room in general.  The URL for the Livestream will be published on the IRC channel during the HackFest. 
## The LiveStream URL is: https://new.livestream.com/accounts/5312056/events/2390441
# Five iPad Mini's will be set up on Webex sessions and hooked up to good mic/speakers to allow participation remotely (click on link for webex session below, password is 'default' for each of them).

The webex sessions should allow folks to participate via audio, video, and web share remotely :)

Since the Hackfest is run as an unconference, its not really knowable ahead of time what will be going on at each Webex, but we will update on IRC and
here on this page as this ebb and flow so people can go to the topics that interest them :)

== Ideas ==
* [[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Main| VTN Project]] Demo
** Demonstrate that VTN controls multiple OpenDaylight Controllers ([[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Implementation|VTN System]]).
** dmm: It looks like the figure implies that each controller controls some number of switches and the sets of switches controlled by each controller don't overlap. Its this the case?
*** hideyuki: Yes, each controller controls some number of switches, and the sets of switches controlled by each controller don't overlap.
** dmm: in addition, does the VTN Coordinator (ODC driver?) do state management among the ODCs?
*** sarath: Yes, VTN Coordinator does state management for the virtual networks (VTN, vBridge, vBridge Interface) managed by VTN Coordinator.
* OF 1.3+ SB Plugin and Protolib
** Hack code on integrating the SB Plugin and Protolib plugins and the SB Plugin and the MD-SAL
** Hack code on adding support for multiple ports for OF 1.3+ (OF is having to change its port... we should support the old and new)
** Hack on code to allow policies like message shaping and connection policing (as well as others)
* Understanding MD-SAL and how to integrate your project with it - move real code
* Understanding Clustering and HA support, and how to add them to your project (Presentation and Hands on Work)
* Controller's native container/tenant support discussion & its usage by other projects
* Openstack ML2 integration with networkconfig.bridgedomain services with OVSDB south-bound plugin
* Start writing some OVSDB models
* Work on OpenStack ML2 integration

== Intro to OpenDaylight ==

Some set of people, hopefully including those who got spun up at the last hackfest, will set up at least a table to walk newcomers through getting code up and working. This should be at least for the <tt>controller</tt> project, but perhaps other projects as well assuming we have code.

= HackFest agenda: June 6-7 =

== Dixon-Erickson Proposal Blueprint creation ==
Goal: collect owners for each row in [[Dixon-Erickson_OpenDaylight_Merged_Controller_Proposal|DE plan]] and build detailed blueprints

* [[D-E_Proposal:Host_Tracker_Plan|Host Tracker]] plan
** Rob Adamn's gerrit commit [https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/438/]
* Consistent, Replicated Data Store: [https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/controller-dev/2013-May/000537.html discuss mail thread]
* Threading support: [https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/controller-dev/2013-May/000495.html discuss mail thread]

== Deep Dive on Virtual Tenant Networking (VTN) Proposal ==

Goal: Introduce VTN Proposal

Time: 2 hours

# [[Media:NEC VTN Model 0606.pdf|Overview of the VTN Proposal]]
# [[Media:NEC VTN Demo 0606.pdf|Live Demo]]
# [[Media:NEC VTN Implementation 0606.pdf|VTN Implementation]]

== Introduction to OpenDaylight ==

* Some set of people should set up at a table or perhaps a whole corner of a room to provide tutorials and help for one or both code bases to get people up to speed. Ideally, this could be paid forward with people passing along their expertise to those coming later.
* This is a request: Could someone do a deep dive into the controller codebase for people who are relatively new to OpenDaylight codebase?

== Additional topics ==

* Patterns and best practices for integrating non-Java projects into the Open Daylight controller
