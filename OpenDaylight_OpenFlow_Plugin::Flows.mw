= Strategy =
Current way to flush a flow to switch looks like this:
# create MD-SAL modeled flow and commit it into dataTree using two phase commit (probably it will be later done through REST)
# FRM gets notified and invokes corresponding rpc (addFlow) on particular service provider (if suitable provider for given node registered)
# the provider (plugin in this case) transforms MD-SAL modeled flow into OF-API modeled flow
# OF-API modeled flow is then flushed into OFLibrary
# OFLibrary encodes flow into particular version of wire protocol and sends it to particular switch
# check on mininet side if flow is set

= Adding flow to OF-switch =
Currently for this purpose there is project test-provider (under openflowplugin). There are several command providers and the one handling flows is '''OpenflowpluginTestCommandProvider'''.

= Removing flow from OF-switch =
TBD

= Modifying flow on OF-switch =
