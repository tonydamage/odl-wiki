= OpenDaylight Controller Driver (ODC Driver) =
The ODC driver module is a sub component of the [[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):VTN_Coordinator|VTN coordinator]] and provides mechanisms to provision and monitor virtual networks and monitor physical networks in the OpenDaylight controller. ODC driver is started during startup of [[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):VTN_Coordinator|VTN coordinator]]
It consists of two sub components
:*[[#Common_Driver_Framework_(CDF)|Common Driver Framework (CDF)]]
:*[[#ODC_Driver|ODC Driver]]

== Common Driver Framework (CDF) ==

The CDF module provides a controller independent processing of the messages sent from [[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Unified Provider Logical Layer (UPLL)|UPLL]] and [[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Unified Provider Physical Layer (UPPL)|UPPL]] modules.

The main functions of this module are
:*Isolate the driver modules from processing messages sent by [[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Unified Provider Logical Layer (UPLL)|UPLL]] and [[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Unified Provider Physical Layer (UPPL)|UPPL]]modules.
:*Provide interfaces to the driver module to install their commands for various operations on the controller (eg: VTN creation).
:*Provide controller management and support different types of controllers.
:*Parse Platform messages and invoke driver methods with appropriate parameters.
:*Provide interface for different drivers to install command handlers.
:*Simplify transaction processing with simplified transaction functions for Vote and Commit.
:*Support for Parallel Update operation across many controllers.
:*The framework can be extended to support all driver modules in a common daemon or individual daemons.

== ODC Driver ==
:* The ODC driver module implements the interfaces for controller connection management and virtual network provisioning and monitoring in the ODC controller.
:* The request will be translated to the appropriate REST APIs and sent to the controller.
