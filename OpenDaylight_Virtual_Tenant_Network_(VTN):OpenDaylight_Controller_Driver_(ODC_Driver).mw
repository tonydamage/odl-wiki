= OpenDaylight Controller Driver (ODC Driver) =
The ODC driver module is a sub component of the [[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):VTN_Coordinator|VTN coordinator]] and provides mechanisms to provision and monitor virtual networks and monitor physical networks in the OpenDaylight controller. ODC driver is started during startup of [[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):VTN_Coordinator|VTN coordinator]]
It consists of two sub components
:*[[#Common_Driver_Framework_(CDF)|Common Driver Framework (CDF)]]
:*[[#ODC_Driver|ODC Driver]]

== Common Driver Framework (CDF) ==

CDF provides a controller independent processing of the messages sent from [[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Unified Provider Logical Layer (UPLL)|UPLL]] and [[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Unified Provider Physical Layer (UPPL)|UPPL]] modules.

The main functions of this module are
:*Isolate the driver modules from processing messages sent by [[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Unified Provider Logical Layer (UPLL)|UPLL]] and [[OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Unified Provider Physical Layer (UPPL)|UPPL]]modules.
:*Provide interfaces to the driver module to install their commands for various operations on the controller (eg: VTN creation).
:*Provide controller management and support different types of controllers.
:*Parse Platform messages and invoke driver methods with appropriate parameters.
:*Provide interface for different drivers to install command handlers.
:*Simplify transaction processing with simplified transaction functions for Vote and Commit.
:*Support for Parallel Update operation across many controllers.
:*The framework can be extended to support all driver modules in a common daemon or individual daemons.

CDF is implemented using the following modules
       vtndrvintf
       vtncacheutil

=== vtndrvintf ===
:* Implements all the features of CDF as listed above.

==== Class Details ====
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Class Name !! Description
|-
| VtnDrvIntf || This class is inherited from Module class and provides the entry point for messages from platform.
This also provides interfaces to add drivers for different types of controllers.
|-
| KtHandler || Abstract interface for handling different message types.
|-
| KtRequestHandler || Template that implements KtHandler to process all messages from platform.
|-
| DriverTxnInterface || Common Transaction handling for drivers
|-
| ControllerFramework || This provides methods to add/delete/update Controllers of different types to the VTN Coordinator.
This also ensures periodic monitoring of controllers and takes appropriate actions
|}

=== vtncacheutil ===
:*  Utility module that provides interfaces for caching configuration entries to validate as a whole and then later commit

==== Class Details ====
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Class Name !! Description
|-
| keytree || cache container that provides interfaces to append config to cache.
| CommonIterator ||  Proves methods to iterate the elements in cache, the option to iterate in VTN hierarchial order is also available.
|}

== ODC Driver ==
:* The ODC driver module implements the interfaces for controller connection management and virtual network provisioning and monitoring in the ODC controller.
:* The request will be translated to the appropriate REST APIs and sent to the controller.
:* Capable of translating the VTN Operations as Commands to VTN Manager in the ODL.

The above features are implemented using these modules
   restjsonutil
   odcdriver

=== restjsonutil ===
:* Utility Module that provides services for json build/parse and handling REST Request/Response.
==== Class Details ====
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Class Name !! Description
|-
| HttpClient || Interface to set up and maintain a connection to an HTTP Web service
|-
| RestClient || Interface to handle Request/Response on a REST Interface
|-
| JsonBuildParse || Interface for building/parsing the json strings for communication 
|}

=== odcdriver ===
:* Implements the interfaces exposed by CDF
:* Registers the driver for controllers of type : ODC (OpenDaylight Controllers)
:* Uses the restjsonutil to communicate

==== Class Details ====
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Class Name !! Description
|-
| OdcModule || Module implementation of odc driver, registers itself as diver for controllers of ODL type.
|-
| ODCController || Implements the various methods according to the features of the ODL Controller.
|-
| ODCVTNCommand || Handle Create/Update/Delete/Read requests for VTN from platform
|-
| ODCVBRCommand || Handle Create/Update/Delete/Read requests for VBridge from platform
| -
| ODCVBRIfCommand || Handle Create/Update/Delete/Read requests for VBridge Interfaces from platform
|}
