== Community Labs ==
Community Labs are available for OpenDaylight test preparation and debug. They can also be used to run test cases when these are difficult to implement at LF because of: special SW requirements, some HW involved like real switches or commercial test tools, or no Robot integration possible. In this last case, the test cases can be manually executed or automated through the Jenkins integration instruction below.
