==NOTICE==
This is a work in progress - just getting some notes placed here for the time being.

==Steps==
sudo docker run -p 6640:6640 --privileged=true -d -i -t davetucker/docker-ovs:2.1.2 /bin/supervisord -n
Assuming you don't have anything using 6640 on your machine. Syntax is <Host Port>:<Container Port> but in this case you must use 6640 inside the container as that's the port where it's listening for connections..

Which would make this:
        mvn -Dovsdbserver.ipaddress=127.0.0.1 -Dovsdbserver.port=6640 -Pintegrationtest verify
>
> As you can see, using the "docker run" command, we are port forwarding the docker's instance's 6640 to
> the host machine's 6641 & we are connecting to 6641 to perform the integration test.
