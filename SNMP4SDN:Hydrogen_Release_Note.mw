==Major Features==
* OpenDayLight SAL plugin
* Support SNMP & CLI as the south bound protocol to enable Ethernet switch on the SDN paradigm
* New mechanisms for switch discovery and topology discovery for Ethernet switch in SDN

==Target Environment==
* SNMP4SDN is tested and validated using JRE 1.7.0_25 on Linux OS of Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.2.0-56-generic x86_64)

==Known Issues and Limitations==
* Vendor-specific APIs are implemented and tested with physical Ethernet switch, and so far only D-Link DGS-3120-24TC switch has been implemented and pass test
* Authentication information is stored in a file (including SNMP community, CLI username, and CLI password), the file is not encrypted in this release
* Flow configuration
** For flow configuration via SNMP, note that only "destination MAC address", "VLAN ID", and "output port" are effective to assign(due to SNMP only supports forwarding table setting)
** For flow configuration on ACL, this function will be in the next release.
