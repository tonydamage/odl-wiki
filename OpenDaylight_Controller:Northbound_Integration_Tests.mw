==Northbound Integration Test Setup==

'''Dependency Setup'''

When running the normal integration test, you only needed a very small subset of bundles running needed for the specific test.  When testing the northbound API, you will need a much more complete set of dependencies to get the controller running and listening for requests.  The existing NorthboundIT.java and its associated pom.xml already has the necessary dependencies included for the Opendaylight Controller and is a good base for future tests.

'''Individual Test Methods'''

Each @Test annotated method in the NorthboundIT is completely independent of the others.  This means that for each test method, the controller will first start up, and upon completing the tests without that method, the controller will shutdown.  Note that this does incur some overhead, so if writing many very small tests, it may be worthwhile to combine them into one method.

===Writing The Tests===

'''Sending a GET Request'''

In this example, we want to give the request to get the subnets in the default container.  The API documentation gives the following to use:
http://127.0.0.1:8080/controller/nb/v2/subnet/default

To send the request to the controller, the URL connection needs to be built with proper authentication.
