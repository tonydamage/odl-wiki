'''Dependency Setup'''

When running the normal integration test, you only needed a very small subset of bundles running needed for the specific test.  When testing the northbound API, you will need a much more complete set of dependencies to get the controller running and listening for requests.  The existing NorthboundIT.java and its associated pom.xml already has the necessary dependencies included for the Opendaylight Controller and is a good base for future tests.
