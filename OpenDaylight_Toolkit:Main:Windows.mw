= OpenDaylight Toolkit on Windows =
Getting started with OpenDaylight Toolkit on Windows

Tested on
* Windows 7
== Getting Started with Eclipse on Windows ==
Tested with Eclipse Kepler 4.3.2 on Windows 7 64-bit
=== Prerequisites ===
* ensure [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase Java SE Development Kit] is installed (jdk 7 or later)
=== Steps ===
# Install [http://git-scm.com/ git-scm Windows client]
# Open up '''Git Bash''', go to a directory where you want to download toolkit, and do '''git clone https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/p/toolkit.git'''
# Open Eclipse
# [to import toolkit project] Eclipse IDE > File > Import > Maven > Existing Maven Projects > Next > Browse (navigate to toolkit project directory) > (ensure all projects except releasepom are selected) > Finish (this may take a while)
# [to build odl controller] Eclipse IDE > Run > Run Configurations.. > Maven Build > opendaylight-assemble-skiput (this may take a while)
# [to run odl controller] Eclipse IDE > Run > Debug Configurations.. > Java Application > opendaylight-controller
=== Steps for simple application ===
# Import toolkit/samples/simple
# Perform fast build on simple application (select simple project in Eclipse IDE > Run > Run Configurations... > Maven Build > opendaylight-assemble-fast)
# (in command) cd toolkit/kit
# npm install (this will install the necessary node modules)
# node provision.js --scaffold <your-ip> (find out your ip address by using ipconfig, if you're not sure try localhost)
# cd ../tool/node
# npm install
# node server.js

Then go to http://localhost:8000/ and you should be able to develop the simple application from there. You can start in samples/simple/src/main/resources/js/app.js. If your setup doesn't work, then try scaffolding again with a different IP address.

== Getting Started with CLI ==
=== Prerequisites ===
* ensure [http://git-scm.com/ git-scm] is installed on your windows so you have git
* ensure [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase java] is installed (jdk 7 or later)
* ensure [http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi maven] is installed or available
Note: you won't be able to install maven like the other tools. You can either directly access the executable bin/mvn or add it to your PATH. (todo more details)
=== Steps ===
# git clone https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/p/toolkit.git
# cd toolkit
# mvn install (this may take a while since you're downloading the entire opendaylight controller)
# cd samples/simple
# mvn install
# cd ../.. (to back to toolkit root directory)
# cd main/target/main-osgipackage/opendaylight
# ./run.sh -console


The controller may take anywhere from a minute to a few minutes to start. Then go to http://localhost:8080/ and you should be able to login OpenDaylight Toolkit with simple App accessible from the overlay menu.

== App Development ==
To provision simple app development workspace
=== Prerequisites ===
* ensure [http://nodejs.org/ nodejs] is installed on your mac
=== Steps ===
# Ensure OpenDaylight controller is running in the background (refer to section above)
# Ensure you are in the toolkit project root directory
# cd kit
# npm install (this will install the necessary node modules)
# node provision.js --scaffold <your-ip> (find out your ip address by using the ifconfig command from your mac's terminal, if you're not sure try localhost)
# cd .. (to go back to the toolkit project root directory)
# cd tool/node
# npm install
# node server.js

Then go to http://localhost:8000/ and you should be able to develop the simple application from there. You can start in samples/simple/src/main/resources/js/app.js. If your setup doesn't work, then try scaffolding again with a different IP address.
