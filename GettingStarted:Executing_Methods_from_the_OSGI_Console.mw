Many thanks to Madhu for these instructions:
<pre>
Please follow these steps. (Reference Switchmanager.implementation).

1. POM.xml under the <Import-Package>, import these 2 packages :
       org.eclipse.osgi.framework.console,
	org.osgi.framework,

2. In the implementation class file (or any other class), inherit from
CommandProvider (implements CommandProvider).

3. Override the getHelp() function. (Refer to SwitchManagerImpl.java)
	-> This will just give helpful hints on the "help" command in the OSGi
console.

4. Any method with the following signature : public void
_<command_name>(CommandInterpreter ci)
  Will be included in the OSGi console with the "command_name" as the
command and the parameters passed in ci.
  Please refer to : public void _pencs(CommandInterpreter ci).

5. Add a method with the following content :
   private void registerWithOSGIConsole() {
	BundleContext bundleContext =
FrameworkUtil.getBundle(this.getClass()).getBundleContext();
	bundleContext.registerService(CommandProvider.class.getName(), this,
null);
   }

6. Call this method from the start() method.
</pre>
