	Purpose</h1>
<p>
	Describe the base services provided by SAL, SAL will try to abstract all the commonalities among different SDN technologies and will provide interfaces for them, here is a schema of the SAL building blocks.</p>

<h1>
	Overview</h1>
<p>
	SAL is not a simple stiching layer but need to contain business logic in order to adapt to the different southbound technologies:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Topology Service is a set of services that allow to convey topology informations like a new node a new link has been discovered and so on.</li>
	<li>
		Data Packet services, in summary the possibility to deliver to applications the packets coming from the agents, if any.</li>
	<li>
		Flow Programming service is supposed to provide the necessary logic to program in the different agents a Match/Actions rule.</li>
	<li>
		Statistics service,&nbsp; will export API to be able to collect statistics at least per:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Flow</li>
			<li>
				Node Connector (port)</li>
			<li>
				Queue</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Inventory service will provide APIs for returning inventory information about the node and node connectors for example</li>
	<li>
		Resource service is a placeholder to query resource status, for now the idea there is still fuzzy</li>
</ul>
