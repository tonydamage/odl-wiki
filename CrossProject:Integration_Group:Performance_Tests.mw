== Introduction ==
Performance tests are needed not only for benchmarking our controller but also for improving our code by continuosly monitoring the collected data. We also stated that for next release Helium our focus will be performance and stability and as a result we have decided to create and maintain this wiki.

== Scope ==
The goal of this wiki is to:
* Provide a set of recommendations for doing performance test
* Describe which performance tests are currently running in OpenDaylight
* Publish performance test results

== Performance metrics ==
We agreed we are going to start with following performance metrics:

Inventory performance:
* Max number of OF switches and ports
* Time/CPU/RAM consumed in learning switches, ports and topology 

Flow performance:
* Max number of flows in memory
* Max flows/sec we can process
* Time/CPU/RAM consumed in pushing flows
