== Introduction ==
Performance tests are needed not only for benchmarking our controller but also for improving our code by continuosly monitoring the collected data. We also stated that for next release '''Helium''' our focus will be performance and stability and as a result we have decided to create and maintain this wiki.

== Scope ==
The goal of this wiki is to:
* Provide a set of recommendations for doing performance test
* Describe which performance tests are currently running in OpenDaylight
* Publish performance test results

== Performance metrics ==
We agreed we are going to start with following performance values:

* Inventory performance:
** Max number of OF switches and ports
** Time/CPU/RAM consumed in learning switches, ports and topology 

* Flow performance:
** Max number of flows in memory
** Max flows/sec we can process
** Time/CPU/RAM consumed in pushing flows

== Test conditions ==

* Controller HW configuration: 
** Use dedicated VM or bare-metal for controller
** CPU: 4 Cores
** RAM: 4 GB

* Controller SW configuration: 
** Use Base edition 
** Set Java memory: Min=2G, Max=4G, in run.sh we have to add following JVM options:
<pre> 
  run.sh     -Xms=2G -Xmx=4G    # Minimum heap size 2G and maximum heap size 4G. Increase to higher values if we encounter OutOfMemoryError crashes 
                         # when MACs and Switches count are increased in CBench cmdline args 
</pre>
** ODL Log level set to ERROR, edit  opendaylight/configuration/logback.xml
