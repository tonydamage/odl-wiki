= Manual libnetconfd/netopeer installation

1.  Download, compile and install libnetconfd/netopeer. The instructions
below are for Ubuntu 12.04
2.  Configure netconf client and server as described in:

OpenDaylight_Controller:Config:Examples:Netconf#Editing_Netconf_Client_Configuration_by_Creating_Initial_Controller_Config_File[Editing_Netconf_Client_Configuration_by_Creating_Initial_Controller_Config_File]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In general you should expect that compiling libnetconf and netopeer in Ubuntu will somewhat bumpy. 

Folks on libnetconf google groups helped a lot. 


10. Install libxml2 (http://xmlsoft.org/)

        sudo apt-cache search libxml2
        sudo apt-get install libxml2

20. Install libxslt
        sudo apt-cache search libxslt
        sudo apt-get install libxslt1.1

    You might find this error when 

    config.status: executing libtool commands
    /bin/rm: cannot remove 'libtoolT': No such file or directory

    Solution:

    edit file <configure> and change this line:

    $RM "$cfgfile"

    to

    $RM -f "$cfgfile"


30. Install libssh2 (www.libssh2.org/)
        sudo apt-cache search libssh2
        sudo apt-get install libssh2-1
        
  It will need openssl or libgcrypt

40. Install libdbus-dev package
    (Important) Do not replace current dbus on Ubuntu by the one in (dbus.freedesktop.org). it is a critical part of the system. I did that and had to recover/reinstall Ubuntu. 
       
        sudo apt-cache search libdbus
    sudo apt-get install libdbus-1-dev

    Always make sure you are installing the correct package

    sudo apt-get update

50. Install doxygen   ( This one's a big one ... took 50 minutes to download on my system )

    sudo apt-get install doxygen

51 Install libcurl-dev

    sudo apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev


60. Pull, Compile and Install libnetconf (code.google.com/p/libnetconf/)

    git clone https://code.google.com/p/libnetconf/

      At the time of writing:
      - If you disable notifications (as below) in libnetconf, netopeer will not compile ( and this is good or bad? :-) )

      $ ./configure --disable-notifications

    The step below is very important otherwise when it is time to test you will hit an access denied issue.

    ./configure --with-nacm-recovery-uid=uid

    the uid above is the uid of the person that will use netopeer-cli to test drive the server. In my case it was 1000 (use <id> command in Unix), therefore

    ./configure --with-nacm-recovery-uid=1000

        Note: in some Ubunti distributions (14.10, for example) you may have to install libxml2-dev, libxslt-dev and libssh-dev.

    make
    make install

70. Pull netopeer, you will get 4 directories.

    git clone https://code.google.com/p/netopeer/

71 Compiling server

    You will need to install libevent

    sudo apt-get install libevent-dev

     Compiling Multi-Level server
      netopeer/server: ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc
      make
      sudo make install

80 Compiling cli

    If you get this error:

    checking for readline in -lreadline... no
    configure: error: Missing libreadline

    You might need to install ncurses (http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ncurses/) and readline (http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/readline/). 
        If you already have these installed, you might need the dev version of the libraries.

    sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev
    sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev

    At the time of this writing I could not find a 64-bit readline package so I downloaded and compiled version 6.2

    After each step you should do <sudo ldconfig>

    Finally ./configure LIBS=-lncurses CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include/libxml2

90. Patch your SSHd configuration. 

    The netconf server (single-level, for instance) will be called automagically by sshd when a netconf client connects. In Ubuntu the file is /etc/ssh/sshd_config

    Port 830
    Subsystem netconf /usr/local/bin/netopeer-server-sl

    Restart SSH

    sudo service ssh stop
    sudo service ssh start

    If sshd does not start probably the configuration file has a problem. 

    Try sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -p 22 -D -d -e to see any issues.

100. Access denied issue in server-sl

    Issue:

    netconf> edit running-config
    edit: no such command, type 'help' for more information.
    netconf> edit-config running

      Type the edit configuration data (close editor by Ctrl-D):
    <toaster xmlns="http://netconfcentral.org/ns/toaster"/>

    NETCONF error: access-denied (application) - creating "toaster" data node is not permitted.

    Solution (David Kupka):

    This is correct behavior as defined in Section 3.7.1 of RFC 6536 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6536#section-3.7.1).

    In libnetconf documentation there is page that should help You configure the Access Control Module: http://libnetconf.googlecode.com/git/doc/doxygen/html/dd/d59/nacm.html
