This file is used by various parts of the system that are not under
configuration subsystem. Changes to this file apply after server
restart. Several important configuration keys and values are listed
below:

|Setting |description
|yangstore.blacklist=.*controller.model.* |This regular expression (can
be OR-ed using pipe character) tells netconf to exclude yang files found
in matching bundle symbolic name from hello message. This is helpful
when dealing with netconf client has parsing problems.

|netconf.config.persister.* settings |See
OpenDaylight Controller:Config:Configuration:Initial[OpenDaylight
Controller:Config:Configuration:Initial]

a|
netconf.tcp.address=0.0.0.0 netconf.tcp.port=8383

netconf.ssh.address=0.0.0.0 netconf.ssh.port=1830 netconf.ssh.pk.path =
./configuration/RSA.pk

netconf.tcp.client.address=127.0.0.1 netconf.tcp.client.port=8383

 || These settings specify netconf server bindings. IP address 0.0.0.0
is used when all available network interfaces should be used by the
netconf server. When starting ssh server, user must provide a private
key. Actual authentication is done in user admin module. By default,
users admin:admin and netconf:netconf can be used to connect via ssh.
Since the ssh bridge acts as a proxy, one needs to specify netconf
plaintext TCP address and port. These settings should be normally same
as those specified by netconf.tcp.* .
