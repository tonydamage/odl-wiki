Various parts of the system that are not under the configuration
subsystem use the file config.ini. Changes to this file apply after a
server restart. The tabulation of several important configuration keys
and values follows:

[cols=",",options="header",]

|Setting |description
|yangstore.blacklist=.*controller.model.* |This regular expression (can
be OR-ed using pipe character) tells netconf to exclude the yang files
found in the matching bundle symbolic name from the hello message. This
is helpful when dealing with a netconf client that has parsing problems.

|netconf.config.persister.* settings |See
OpenDaylight Controller:Config:Configuration:Initial[OpenDaylight

netconf.tcp.address=0.0.0.0 netconf.tcp.port=8383

netconf.ssh.address=0.0.0.0 netconf.ssh.port=1830 netconf.ssh.pk.path =
./configuration/RSA.pk

netconf.tcp.client.address=127.0.0.1 netconf.tcp.client.port=8383

 || These settings specify the netconf server bindings. IP address
0.0.0.0 is used when all available network interfaces must be used by
the netconf server. When starting the ssh server, the user must provide
a private key. Actual authentication is done in the user admin module.
By default, users admin:admin and netconf:netconf can be used to connect
by means of ssh. Since the ssh bridge acts as a proxy, one needs to
specify the netconf plaintext TCP address and port. These settings must
normally be identical to those specified by netconf.tcp.* .
