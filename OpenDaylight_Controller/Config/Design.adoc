This page contains documented design for the config subsystem. +

[[core]]
== Core

Config subsystem core consists of 2 modules:

* *config-api* - containing base API definition for config subsystem.
* *config-manager* - implementation of *config-api* that uses JMX as its
registry/storage.

More information on config subsystem can be found at
OpenDaylight_Controller:Config:Main[Config Subsystem] and
OpenDaylight_Controller:Config:Configuration[Configuration process].

[[config-persister]]
== Config persister

Config persister modules in config subsystem contain:

* API for config persister
* XML file based storage adapter
* XML directory based storage adapter

Detailed information as well as component diagram can be found at
OpenDaylight_Controller:Netconf:Design#Config_persister_impl[Config
Persister].

[[yang-jmx-generator]]
== Yang JMX generator

Yang JMX generator is responsible for generating Java classes (binding)
that allow a module to be managed by config subsystem. These classes
serve as an interface between resources and config subsystem. +
Generator consists of 2 modules:

* *Yang-jmx-generator* - contains metamodel for config subsystem
binding. This metamodel is built on top of parsed _SchemaContext_ from
YANG_Tools:Main[yangtools]. This metamodel is also used by
*config-netconf-connector* from netconf subsystem when transformation
between XML and Open type objects is performed.
* *Yang-jmx-generator-plugin* - contains an implementation of
_CodeGenerator_ for yang-maven-plugin and generates the actual files
from parsed metamodel.

[[config-module-archetype]]
== Config module archetype

There is a prototype of maven archetype for bundles with configurable
modules. It should make the process of building "config subsystem aware"
bundles easier.

[[managed-modules]]
== Managed modules

Managed modules are config-subsystem aware components, that provide
configurable modules into the config subsystem. Some of them are split
into api and one or more implementations.

[[threadpools]]
=== Threadpools

Config subsystem wrapper over java threadpools.

[[netty]]
=== Netty

Wrapper over netty's utils such as Timers, EventExecutors etc.

[[logback]]
=== Logback

Wrapper over slf4j logging api. This wrapper allows logback
configuration over netconf/config subsystem.

[[shutdown]]
=== Shutdown

Wrapper over a simple shutdown utility for controller. Shutdown is
performed by stopping the system bundle in OSGi environment or exiting
the JVM if OSGi stop fails.

[[netconf-config-dispatcher]]
=== Netconf config dispatcher

Thin wrapper over netconf dispatchers. (This should be probably moved to
netconf)

[[testing-modules]]
=== Testing modules

Used for unit/integration testing of config and netconf subsystem.
