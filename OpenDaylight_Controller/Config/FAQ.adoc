=== There is JMX. Why do we need another system?

Java Management Extensions (JMX) provides programmatic access to
management data, defining a clear structure on the level of a single
object (MBeans). It provides the mechanism to query and set information
exposed from these MBeans, too. It is adequate for replacing properties,
but it does not treat the JVM container for what it is: a collection of
applications working in concert. When the configuration problem is taken
to the level of an entire system, there are multiple issues which JMX
does not solve:

* The need to validate that a proposed system is semantically valid
before an attempt to change is made
* The ability to synchronize modification multiple properties at the
same time, such that both occur at the same time
* The ability to express dependencies between applications
* Machine-readable descriptions of layouts of configuration data

[[why-use-yang]]
=== Why use YANG?

The problem of configuring a device has been tackled in
https://ietf.org[IETF] for many years now, initially using
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNMP[SNMP] (with
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_information_base[MIB] as the
data definition language). While the protocol has been successful for
monitoring devices, it has never gained traction as the unified way of
configuring devices. The reasons for this have been
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3535[analyzed] and
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6241[NETCONF] was standardized as
the successor protocol. NETCONF provides the abstractions to deal with
configuration validation, and relies on
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6020[YANG] as its data modeling language.
The configuration subsystem is designed to completely align with NETCONF
such that it can be used as the native transport with minimal
translation.
