[[getting-started-with-git-and-gerrit]]
== Getting started with Git and Gerrit

Git is an opensource distributed version control system (dvcs) written
in the C language and originally developed by Linus Torvalds and others
to manage the Linux kernel. In Git, there is no central copy of the
repository. After you have cloned the repository, you have a functioning
copy of the source code with all the branches and tagged releases, in
your local repository.

Gerrit is an opensource web-based collaborative code review tool that
integrates with Git. It was developed at Google by Shawn Pearce. Gerrit
provides a framework for reviewing code commits before they are accepted
into the code base. Changes can be uploaded to Gerrit by any user.
However, the changes are not made a part of the project until a code
review is completed. Gerrit is also a good collaboration tool for
storing the conversations that occur around the code commits.

The OpenDaylight source code is hosted in a repository in Git.
Developers must use Gerrit to commit code to the OpenDaylight
repository.

For more information on Git, see http://git-scm.com/. For more
information on Gerrit, see https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/.

'''NOTE: You must have a Gerrit account before you can start
contributing to the OpenDaylight project. '''

[[setting-up-a-gerrit-account]]
=== Setting up a Gerrit account

1.  Using a Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox browser, go to
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit.

::
  The main page shows existing Gerrit requests. These are patches that
  have been pushed to the repository and not yet verified, reviewed, and
  merged.

::
  _'NOTE: If you already have an OpenDaylight account, you can click
  *Sign In* in the top right corner of the page and follow the
  instructions to enter the OpenDaylight page._'

::
  If you do not have an existing OpenDaylight account, click *Account
  signup/management* on the top bar of the main Gerrit page.

1.  In the *WS02 Identity Server page*, click *Sign-up* in the left
pane.
+
There is also an option to authenticate your sign in with OpenID. This
option is not described in this document.

1.  Click on the *Sign-up with User Name / Password* image to continue
to the actual sign-up page.

1.  Fill out the details in the account creation form and then click
*Submit*.

You now have an OpenDaylight account that can be used with Gerrit to
pull the OpenDaylight code.

[[generating-ssh-keys-for-your-system]]
=== Generating SSH keys for your system

You must have SSH keys for your system to register with your Gerrit
account. The method for generating SSH keys is different for different
types of operating systems.

The key you register with Gerrit must be identical to the one you will
use later to pull or edit the code. For example, if you have a
development VM which has a different UID login and keygen than that of
your laptop, the SSH key you generate for the VM is different from the
laptop. If you register the SSH key generated on your VM with Gerrit and
do not reuse it on your laptop when using Git on the laptop, the pull
fails.

*NOTE: For more information on SSH keys for Ubuntu, see
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys. For generating SSH
keys for Windows, see
https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys.*

For a system running Ubuntu operating system, follow the steps below:

1.  Run the following command:

-----------------
mkdir ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
ssh-keygen -t rsa
-----------------

1.  You are prompted for a location to save the keys, and a passphrase
for the keys.
+
This passphrase protects your private key while it is stored on the hard
drive. You must use the passphrase to use the keys every time you need
to login to a key-based system.

----------------------------------------------------------
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/b/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/b/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/b/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
----------------------------------------------------------

Your public key is now available as *.ssh/id_rsa.pub* in your home
folder.

[[registering-your-ssh-key-with-gerrit]]
=== Registering your SSH key with Gerrit

1.  Using a Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox browser, go to
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit.
2.  Click *Sign In* to access the OpenDaylight repository.

Click your name in the top right corner of the window and then click
*Settings*.

Click *SSH Public Keys* under *Settings*.

Click *Add Key*.

image:Gerrit Setup Add SSH Key.jpg[Gerrit Setup Add SSH Key.jpg,title="Gerrit Setup Add SSH Key.jpg"]

In the *Add SSH Public Key* text box, paste the contents of your
*id_rsa.pub* file and then click *Add*.

To verify your SSH key is working correctly, try using an SSH client to
connect to Gerrit's SSHD port.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$ ssh -p 29418 <sshusername>@git.opendaylight.org
Enter passphrase for key '/home/cisco/.ssh/id_rsa': 
****    Welcome to Gerrit Code Review    ****
