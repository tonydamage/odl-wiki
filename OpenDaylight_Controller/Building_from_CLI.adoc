In order to build the controller project from CLI, the following
requirement must be met:

* Use *JDK 1.7+* (Note the code is actually compiled to be compliant
with Java 1.6 but if you use the JDK 1.6 there is a good chance to run
into: )
* Set the *JAVA_HOME* to your java path, e.g.,
JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle if using official oracle jdk
* Use *Maven 3+*
* Build machine must be connected to Internet (i know seems such a
trivial requirement, but it's better to spell it out, this is needed
because Maven build tool will need to retrieve the build tools from the
repositories and also the project is dependent on third-party artifact
that are stored in a maven repository)

Once these tools have been installed, then to build the project you need
to:

1.  Go to the distribution directory available under
_opendaylight/distribution_
2.  Pick the distribution to build, usually the one needed is
_opendaylight_ but the distribution directory is structured in such a
way that multiple distributions can be hosted in the same place.
3.  Go under the selected distribution (most likely _opendaylight_) and
run the command: *_mvn clean install_*
4.  Either:
* Run the controller from the target directory
* Pick the zip file and deploy in a separate machine

_NOTEs_

* Maven build tools especially first time is launched will download many
packages from the maven repository, so it will take a while depending on
the connection speed. After first build many build packages are locally
cached so build gets significantly faster.
* Maven build may run out of PermGen depending on the number of
artifacts built, this is usually the case when building the
_opendaylight_ distribution for this the PermGen need to be increased.
In order to do this and to make permanent the changes set in the
environment the following environment variable:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m"
/* syntax for setting varies on the OS used by the build machine.*/
-------------------------------------------------------------------

* If you receive a Maven error when building integration tests you can
skip building those tests running the following:

------------------------------------
mvn clean install -DskipTests 
/* instead of "mvn clean install" */
------------------------------------

* If you want Maven to fork a process for comping when running on a
multi-core platform for speedup:

--------------------------------------------------------
mvn clean install -DskipTests  -Dmaven.compile.fork=true
/* instead of "mvn clean install" */
--------------------------------------------------------
