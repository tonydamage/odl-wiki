Jolokia is remote JMX with JSON over HTTP. It is fast, simple, polyglot
and has unique features. It's JMX on Capsaicin.

The right approach to include Jolokia is to download minimal Jolokia
OSGi Agent and run it on the existing Controller's Gemini Web Container.
Unfortunately, there is a bit of work involved and hence taking the
following shortcut.

* Download Jolokia OSGi full bundle from
http://labs.consol.de/maven/repository/org/jolokia/jolokia-osgi-bundle/1.1.3/jolokia-osgi-bundle-1.1.3.jar[jolokia-osgi-bundle-1.1.3.jar]
* Copy the jolokia-osgi-bundle-1.1.3.jar into the controller's plugin
folder :
distribution.opendaylight-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-osgipackage/opendaylight/plugins
* Add the following configurations at the very end of
distribution.opendaylight-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-osgipackage/opendaylight/configuration/config.ini
:

::
  org.jolokia.agentContext=/jolokia
  +
  org.jolokia.debug=true
  +
  org.osgi.service.http.port=9090

* Start the controller
* Open a browser instance and open : http://:9090/jolokia/list (this
will return a gigantic JSON with all the info obtained through JMX).
* Client libraries can be downloaded for Java and Javascript from :
http://www.jolokia.org/download.html

NOTE : CORS support must be enabled in a separate jolokia.xml. (Will
update more info once I get it working).
