So be you simple, decent, kind, +
With gentle heart and quiet mind; +
And if to righteous anger stung, +
Restrain your temper and your tongue. +
Let thought for others be your guide, +
And patience triumph over pride . . . +
With charity for those who err, +
Live life so folks may say you were-- +
God bless your heart!--A Character. +

|MD-SAL: Clustering: Initial Sharding Manager
|https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/q/project:controller+branch:master+topic:clustering+status:merged,n,z[DONE]
|Initial Implementation of Sharding Manager (drop-in replacement of in
memory data store). A single shard is run on a single node but is
fronted by Akka actors.

|MD-SAL: Clustering: Distributing Shards in a cluster |Delayed - To be
completed by 7/9/2014 |These changes involve serialization of messages
including NormalizedNode both over the wire and on disk. It also
involves implementing reading of configuration and creating a custom
strategy for sharding data based on modules.
