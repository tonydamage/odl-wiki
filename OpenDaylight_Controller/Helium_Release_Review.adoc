== Quality Assurance (test coverage, etc)

MD-SAL is exercised by :

1.  Over 250 system tests in the integration project
2.  At least 450 system tests elsewhere awaiting sufficient developer
infrastructure so they can be added to the integration project.
3.  Clustering has undergone automated system testing for the scenarios
listed
OpenDaylight_Controller:MD-SAL:Architecture:Clustered_Data_Store#Clustering_Scenarios[
here] (pending available developer infrastructure to add to the
integration project)

Code coverage is not being reported to sonar due to ongoing issues with
sonar.opendaylight.org being able to receive them.
