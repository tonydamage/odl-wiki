== Technical Architecture

In Hydrogen Release, the OpenDaylight controller consists of the
following modules:

*
OpenDaylight_Controller:Architectural_Framework#Service_Abstraction_Layer[AD-SAL]
- API-Driven Service Abstraction Layer
* AD-SAL Network Service Functions for OpenFlow-capable nodes:
** Switch Manager
** Statistics Manager
** Host Tracker
** ARP Handler
** Forwarding Rules Manager (FRM)
** Topology Manager
*
OpenDaylight_Controller:Architectural_Framework#High_Availability[Clustering
and High-Availability Services] for AD-SAL
* OpenDaylight_Controller:MD-SAL:Developer_Guide[MD-SAL] - Model-Driven
Service Adaptation Layer - a set of infrastructure common and generic
services for applications and plugins (basically, a "plumbing" that
connects applications and plugins to each other).
* MD-SAL Base Network Functions:
** Topology Exporters
** Inventory Managers
* MD-SAL Network Service Functions for OpenFlow-capable nodes:
** Forwarding Rules Manager (FRM)
** Statistics Manager
* MD-SAL Netconf Connector (Southbound Netconf Plugin)
* OpenDaylight_Controller:MD-SAL:Restconf#How_it_works[MD-SAL Restconf
Connector] (Northbound Restconf Plugin) - an infrastructure component
that renders REST APIs for device/service models loaded into the
controller
* OpenDaylight_Controller:Config:Main[Config Subsystem] - Netconf/Yang
based framework for configuration, performance and fault management of
controller infrastructure and plugins deployed into the controller
* NSF Adapters - Network Service Function Adapter that allow the MD-SAL
based OF1.0/1.3 Plugin to talk with AS-SAL based Network Service
Functions

The controller architecture, as implemented for Hydrogen, is shown in
the following figure. The figure shows the Service Provider edition
example,, which in addition to Base Edition controller components and
plugins, contains the BGP-LS/PCEP and LISP plugins, the Affinity, LISP
and PCEP Services, and the D4A Defense application.
