== Introduction

The OpenDaylight Controller is a highly available, modular, extensible,
scalable, and multi-protocol Controller infrastructure built for SDN
deployment on modern heterogenous multi-vendor networks. The model
driven Service Abstraction Layer provides the needed abstractions to
support multiple Southbound protocols via Plugins. The Application
oriented extensible north-bound architecture provides a rich set of
Northbound APIs via RESTful web services for loosely coupled
applications and OSGi services for co-located applications The OSGi
framework, upon which the Controller platform is built on is responsible
for the Modular and extensible nature of the Controller and also
provides the versioning and life-cycle management for OSGi modules and
services.

Please see the OpenDaylight_Controller:Main[Main OpenDaylight Controller
page] for more details.

|Name |Description
|Model Driven SAL  |Please see a
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Controller:Architectural_Framework#Evolution_of_the_Controller_Service_Abstraction_Layer[summary
of the MD-SAL] and a more
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Controller:Model-Driven_Controller_Service_Abstraction_Layer[detailed
MD-SAL description].

|HA |Basic clustering and support for transactional NB API.

|Filtered PacketIn |Allow applications using PacketIn to request to
receive only certain kinds of packets.

|Netconf SB |Support Netconf as a SB protocol

|FCAPS support |Support for managability of the controller itself. Note,
the FCAPS items are for things like configuring the log level or the
size of the thread pool that have to do with managing the controller
itself, not things like pushing a flow.
