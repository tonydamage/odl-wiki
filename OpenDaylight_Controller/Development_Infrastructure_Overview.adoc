The rough code flow is depicted below:

 +

1.  *Pull code*: contributor pulls code from the authoritative git repo
2.  *Pull dependency artifacts*: Most Java/OSGI code bases have a large
number of dependencies managed by maven. During build the artifacts
(usually binary jars) for those dependencies are pulled from a
Development Nexus Artifact Repository.
3.  *Hack code*: contributor hacks on the code
4.  *Push code*: Contributor pushes code to the pending changes
HEAD:refs/for/<branch> for code review
5.  *Trigger Jenkins Verification:*
6.  *Runs CI*: Jenkin’s runs Continuous Integration (builds,tests,
static analysis, etc… whatever the project has decided is needful for
the health of the code base)
7.  *Indicates patch verified*: Presuming everything checks out OK,
Jenkin’s indicates to Gerrit the patch is verified
8.  *Get patch to review:* A committer picks up the patch for
consideration
9.  *Reviews patch:* committer determines whether the patch looks like a
good idea
10. *Submits patch*: committer indicates to Gerrit that the patch is
should be submitted to the <branch> +
11. *Merge patch into <branch>*: Now that the patch is both approved and
verified, Gerrit merges it into the branch
12. *Trigger Jenkins Merge CI*: Jenkins is triggered to run the CI on
the result of the merge

*Run's Merge CI*: Jenkin’s kicks off the builds for the new artifacts
that will need to be in the Development Nexus Artifact Repo

1.  *Upload new artifacts*: If builds (and possible other CI tasks) are
successful, Jenkin’s uploads the new artifacts to the Development Nexus
Artifact Repo
