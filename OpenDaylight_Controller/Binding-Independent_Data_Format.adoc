[[overview]]
== Overview

In the context of the Controller SAL, data are modeled in a tree form
similar to XML, but with some modifications to support multiple versions
of data models and controller components. The main difference is
replacement of XML QName with a new QName defined in Section 6, which
allows tree branching based on data schema revisions.

image:Binding Independent Data Format.jpg[Binding Independent Data Format.jpg,title="Binding Independent Data Format.jpg"]

* QName – an identifier of a node type, similar to the XML QName
* DOMNode – Base representation of a node in the data tree; it defines
basic node parameters, such as the QName. There are two DOMNode types:
** SimpleNode – Represents a node that contains only one simple value
(such as integer, string, etc…)
** CompositeNode – Represents a node that contains other nodes; it does
not contain a simple value.
* NodeModification – Base representation of a modification to be applied
to a node. There are two NodeModification types:
** CompositeNodeModification – Represents changes to the composite node,
such as replacement of the contents of a composite node.
** SimpleNodeModification – Represents changes to a simple node, such as
replacement of a value or removal of a node.

We did not modeled the binding-independent data form directly using the
YANG terms, because of the existence of the YANG anyxml statement (which
would require different approach than the rest of Data DOM tree) and the
analysis of the current usage of this statement prevented us from using
direct YANG to data node types mapping.

[[nodes]]
== Nodes

Each node must have a QName. Multiple nodes with the same QName could
exist in the same container node.

[[simple-node]]
=== Simple Node

The Simple Node represents a leaf in the data tree that does not contain
any nested nodes, but the value of node. In terms of XML The Simple Node
is an element that contains only text data (CDATA or PCDATA).

The Simple Node is a manifestation of the following YANG data schema
constructs:

* leaf – simple node could represent YANG leafs of all types, except for
the empty type, which in XML form is similar to an empty container.
* item in a leaf-list

[[composite-node]]
=== Composite Node

The Composite Node represents a branch in the data tree. It can contain
nested composite nodes or leaf nodes. In terms of XML, the Composite
Node is an element which does not contain text data directly (CDATA or
PCDATA), only other nodes. The Composite Node is the manifestation of
the following YANG data schema constructs:

* container – the Composite Node represents the YANG container and could
contain all children schema nodes of that container
* item in the list – the composite node represents one item in the YANG
list and could contain all children schema nodes of that list item.
* anyxml
* leaf with empty type

[[node-modifications]]
== Node Modifications

In use cases where state data changes, node modifications are modeled as
a part of additional metadata in the data tree. Modification types are
based on Netconf edit-config RPCs. In order to modify the configuration
or state data tree a user must create a tree representing the
modification of the data and apply the modification to the target tree.

[[simple-node-modifications]]
=== Simple Node Modifications

The simple node supports the following modifications:

* replace - data identified by the node containing this modification
replaces any related data in the target data tree; if no such data
exists in the target data tree, it is created.
* create - data identified by the node containing this modification is
added to the target data tree if and only if the data does not already
exist in target data store. If the data exists, an error is returned
with an error value of "data-exists".
* delete –data identified by the node containing this modification is
deleted from the target data tree if and only if the data currently
exists in the target data tree. If the data does not exist, an error is
returned with an error value of "data-missing".
* remove - The data identified by the node containing this attribute is
deleted from the target data tree if the data currently exists in the
target data tree. If the data does not exist, the modification is
silently ignored.

[[composite-node-modifications]]
=== Composite Node Modifications

The composite node supports the following modifications:

* merge - data identified by the node containing this modification is
merged with the data at the corresponding level in the data tree
* replace - data identified by the node containing this modification
replaces any related data in the target data tree; if no such data
exists in the target data tree, it is created.
* create - data identified by the node containing this modification is
added to the target data tree if and only if the data does not already
exist in target data store. If the data exists, an error is returned
with an error value of "data-exists".
* delete –data identified by the node containing this modification is
deleted from the target data tree if and only if the data currently
exists in the target data tree. If the data does not exist, an error is
returned with an error value of "data-missing".
* remove - data identified by the node containing this attribute is
deleted from the target data tree if the data currently exists in the
target data tree. If the data does not exist, the modification is
silently ignored.

[[functional-requirements]]
== Functional Requirements

The data model:

* MUST support data described in multiple revisions of the same schema.
This is achieved by introducing Revision into QName
