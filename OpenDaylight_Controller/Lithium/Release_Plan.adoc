Currently not known any incompatible project.

[[compatibility-with-previous-releases]]
== Compatibility with Previous Releases

[[removed-apis-andor-functionality]]
=== Removed APIs and/or Functionality

* Deprecated MD-SAL APIs, which were deprecated during Helium release.
(TBD: Link to tracking bug)

[[deprecated-apis-andor-functionality]]
=== Deprecated APIs and/or Functionality

* Some of APIs / concepts present in MD-SAL
** these APIs will be Deprecated when replacement APIs / features are
done. Migration and replacement will be documented as part of JavaDoc
for deprecated APIs.
** Backwards compatibility is to be preserved for Lithium.
* AD-SAL and AD-SAL based components (opendaylight/adsal)

[[changed-apis-andor-functionality]]
=== Changed APIs and/or Functionality

* MD-SAL APIs - addition of new concepts, better usability. (TBD: Link
to tracking bug)
* Yang Model Utilities, which were deprecated during Helium release.
(TBD: Link to tracking bug)

[[themes-and-priorities]]
== Themes and Priorities

* Decreasing Technical Debt
* Better developer usability/experience
* Performance Improvements

[[requests-from-other-projects]]
== Requests from Other Projects

For each API / feature request, the requesting project MUST:

* open Enhancement bug in Bugzilla describing request with Issue Type:
Improvement, Change Request or New Feature
* create an entry as described in
Simultaneous_Release:Per-Project_Lithium_Release_Plan_Template#Example_Request[Release
Plan - Request template], which will also contain number / link to the
bug. After creating the entry, the requesting project MUST:

:* send an e-mail to release@lists.opendaylight.org (mandated by
Simultaneous Release)

:* and both projects' dev lists using this template (mandated by
Simultaneous Release)
