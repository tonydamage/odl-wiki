Yang models are used in the MD-SAL and in MD-SAL-based applications to
define all APIs: inter-component APIs, plugin APIs, northbound APIs,
etc. Yang models are used to generate Java APIs at compile time with
YANG Tools:Main[OpenDaylight Yang Tools] and to render REST APIs at run
time according to the
http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-bierman-netconf-restconf/[RESTCONF]
specification. Plugins designed for MD-SAL define yang models for their
northbound REST APIs, which are then exposed to applications via an
MD-SAL RESTCONF adapter.

The following MD-SAL northbound APIs are currently available:

* *Inventory*:

https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/controller/job/controller-merge/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/opendaylight/md-sal/model/model-inventory/target/site/models/opendaylight-inventory.html[Top-Level
Inventory]: list of all nodes known to the controller. Nodes can be of
different types (OpenFlow, Netconf, ...), but they all share the common
base node type defined here.
**
https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/controller/job/controller-merge/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/opendaylight/md-sal/model/model-flow-service/target/site/models/flow-node-inventory.html[OpenFlow
Nodes]: extends the top-level inventory node with OF-specific features
that allow retrieving and programming of OF-specific state, such as
ports, tables, flows, etc.

* *Topology*:
**

Topology]: list of all topologies known to the controller. Topologies
can be of different types (L3 unicast, IS-IS, OSPF, OF), but they all
share the common base topology type defined here.

unicast IGP topology]: extends the Base topology with attributes common
to all link-state IGPs.

IS-IS
