[[schema-definitions]]
== Schema Definitions

The Binding Independent Data Schema describes the structure of data,
procedures and notifications provided by a module.

The schema is based on YANG, but some terms and definitions were adapted
to better fit the Java class system and to support Controller use cases.

The schemas are used to define:

* Modules – grouping of exposed functionality, features, types, RPCs and
data structures.
* Features – a mechanism by which portions of the schema are marked as
conditional.
* Types – data types that may be used locally in the module, in modules
or submodules that include it, and by other modules
* Data Structures – definition of data nodes in the data tree
* RPCs – module operations
* Notifications
* Relationships between data
* Validation constraints
* Extensions of other modules and their functionality (augmentation)
* YANG Extensions

[[handling-of-multiple-module-revisions]]
=== Handling of Multiple Module Revisions

This document introduces a layer of separation that isolates data, RPCs
and notifications, based on the revision of modules, to support multiple
versions of the clients at the same time without the risk of
accidentally changing data, which semantics changed between revisions.

Because multiple revisions of the same module can co-exist in the
system, the architecture must support components (plugins) responsible
for translating data between different module revisions [3].

[[qnames]]
=== QNames

A regular XML QName consists of a local element name and an XML
namespace. To support versioning, module revision was added.

In context of YANG, a QName is a full name of a defined node, type,
procedure or a notification.[4] A QName consists of an XML namespace, a
YANG model revision and a local name of defined type. It is used to
prevent name clashes between nodes with the same local name, but from
different schemas.

QName = (XMLNamespace,Revision,LocalName)

Where:

* XMLNamespace – namespace assigned to the YANG module with defined
element, type, procedure or notification.
* Revision – revision of the YANG module that describes the element
* LocalName – YANG schema identifier that was defined for this node in
the YANG module

[[rpcs]]
=== RPCs

In regular Netconf/YANG use cases, RPCs are used to model functionality
and APIs provided by a Netconf server to a Netconf client. In context of
the Controller SAL, RPCs are used to model functionality provided by
Providers and consumed by Consumers.

[[the-java-model-of-the-yang-schema]]
== The Java Model of the YANG Schema

The following figure shows the binding-independent representation of the
YANG schema.

A YANG parser in the Binding Generator component generates Java Model
objects.

[[unknown-schema-nodes-extension-handling]]
== Unknown Schema Nodes & Extension Handling

The YANG specification allows for presence of schema nodes that were not
defined in the original YANG specification. Typically, these nodes are
defined in modules with one or more extension statements, but no further
semantic of this node is defined in a computer-understandable form (e.g.
valid use of the node, where it could be used).

To model this we added the notion of 'Unknown Schema Nodes'. An Unknown
Schema Node could be a child of any schema node. It is used to store the
extension information and to provide it to components that understand
its semantics.

[[extension-node-class-hierarchy]]
=== Extension Node Class Hierarchy

* ExtensionDefinition - Schema Node that defines the YANG extension. The
QName of ExtensionDefinition is the base for the YANG statement and is
used as the identifier of the extension.
* ExtensionSchemaNode – representation of the statement defined by the
extension. Note that this schema node has two QNames:
** name – the name of the schema node in the YANG module. It is based on
the argument of the extension and the prefix of the YANG module.
** nodeTypeQName – Qname of the Extension Definition that defined this
extension schema node.

[[handling-of-nodes-defined-by-extensions]]
=== Handling of Nodes Defined by Extensions

The implementation and handling of extension-defined schema nodes is out
of the scope of the YANG schema and model, which are used to represent
schema in structured and usable form, which is to be consumed by other
components.
