The OpenDaylight Controller provides you with a centralized logical view
of their physical network topology, and enables you to coordinate
forwarding rules changes with any of the network devices, on behalf of
applications that directly manage network policies.

OpenDaylight Controller uses the LLDP messages to discover the topology
of the connected OpenFlow Devices. The *Topology View* tab provides a
graphical view of the topology with switches and hosts. The OpenDaylight
Controller's Topology Manager stores and manages information about the
devices in the domain, including their capabilities and reachability.
This information is stored and managed by the Topology Manager. Other
components, including the ARP handler, Host Tracker, Device Manager, and
Switch Manager help generate the topology database for the Topology
Manager.
