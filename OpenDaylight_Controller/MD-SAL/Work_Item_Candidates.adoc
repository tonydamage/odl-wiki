This page contains ideas for work items that need to be done
post-Hydrogen. It's just an unprioritized list right now.

[[yang-tools]]
= Yang Tools

* Code generation from models:
** Skeletons for service providers and service consumers
** More advanced checking (parameter ranges, for example)
* WADL generation from yang modules
* Improve automated generation of documentation (both REST and Java)
* Python language binding for yang modules and remote Python library for
controller clients
* JavaScript language binding: generate JavaScript from models in
runtime, which could be downloaded by clients at runtime

[[controller]]
= Controller

* Add documentation generator from yang tools into the controller
runtime. When the controller finds a new model, it can auto-generate
documentation for it as well. Make the documentation available in the
controller's web server.
* Fix configuration packaging; right now, config models for all projects
need to be included in the config subsystem, which is in the controller
* Notifying plugins when the first listener for a notification registers
and the last unregisters.
** Use Case: Packet Decode. If someone is listening for DHCPDecode...
then DHCP decode registers to listen for UDPDecode. When the last
listener deregisters from DHCPDecode, it stops listening for UDPDecode
* Move component wiring configuration from the Config Subsystem to
something simpler
* Create/improve troubleshooting tools for MD-SAL & protocol plugins -
statistics, message traces, etc.
* Fix component initialization/loading order and add model dependencies
to component loading & initialization.
* Cleanup Flow and Inventory yang models
* Move OpenFlow related functionality form the Controller into its own
project (e.g. openflow models, OF NSFs, etc.) The controller should be
just the container and infrastructure (configuration, SAL, etc.)
* Memory footprint optimizations
* Make bundle startup order deterministic
* Move clustering into its own project

[[netconf-client]]
= Netconf Client

* Implement automatic renconnect after connection to the server has been
lost

[[bgp-ls-plugin]]
= BGP-LS Plugin

* Enable listening to BGP port so that remote peers can initiate the
session

[[openflow-plugin]]
= OpenFlow Plugin

* Migrate onto the Configuration Subsystem
* Do proper MarK & Sweep state sync between controller & switch on
switch reconnect
