[[what-is-it]]
== WHAT IS IT

*The config subsystem is an activation and configuration framework,
roughly similar to what Blueprint would do should it also handle
statistics and allow for run-time rewiring.*

Config subsystem allows the developers to

* expose configuration and service dependencies of their application,
* utilize service and configuration injection,
* expose runtime statistics of their application,
* leave the lifecycle management of the instances of their application
to the config subsystem,
* package their application into one or more configurable Modules* (one
bundle, Multiple configurable modules in it).

It enables the operators and endusers to

* create new instances of applications at startup or while the
controller is running,
* destroy and reconfigure running applications in a safe and
transactional manner,
* collect statistics of running applications,
* and to invoke rpcs on Module instances.

* _Module is a generic, manageable unit recognized by config subsystem
also suitable for JMX._

*The config subsystem is a home grown solution and in its core it is
just a manager built around JMX registry that enables its users to
change Modules in that registry(and their configuration) in a safe
manner.*

*The config subsystem uses yang modeling language as a language for
modeling the configuration, dependencies and state data for Modules.*

Note: The word *module* can mean a lot of different things and
(unfortunately) its also the element of config subsystem. For this
reason we will try to distinguish the Modules from config subsystem by
using capital M.

[[additional-components]]
=== ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS

In addition to the core manager around JMX, there are a few components
that fall into(or are coupled with) the config subsystem:

* *Netconf northbound interface* - Northbound NETCONF server tied to
config subsystem.
* *Yang jmx config generator* - Yang-maven-plugin compatible code
generator, that generates specific Module interfaces and stub
implementations from YANG models.
* *Config persister* - Responsible for persisting configuration changes
in the controller and pushing initial configuration changes to the
controller on startup.
* *Wrapper Modules for commonly used resources* - Configurable Modules
generated for common resources such as Threadpools to allow
configurability, manageability and reusability for these resources.

Detailed information about the components forming config subsystem can
be found at the
OpenDaylight_Controller:MD-SAL:MD-SAL_Document_Review:Config_SubSystem#COMPONENT_MAP[Component
map section]. In addition, there is a page briefly describing the
OpenDaylight_Controller:Config:Design[design of config subsystem]
(design for netconf subsystem can be found at
OpenDaylight_Controller:Netconf:Design[design of netconf subsystem]).

[[interfaces-to-config-subsystem]]
=== INTERFACES TO CONFIG SUBSYSTEM

Config subsystem is accessible in 4 ways:

* NETCONF northbound
* RESTCONF northbound (via a loopback netconf connection instatiated by
default using initial config file)
* JMX (as JMX is the core of config subsystem)
* From the code

[[assumed-knowledge]]
=== ASSUMED KNOWLEDGE

Users of the config subsystem should consider consulting following
resources:

[[for-developers]]
==== FOR DEVELOPERS

* YANG - Developers of applications use YANG language in order to
describe the configuration, runtime state and dependencies of their
applications.
* JMX (optional) - JMX is used as a core of config subsystem and in
order to fully understand the config subsystem (especially
config-manager) one should understand how JMX works.
* Tutorial on how to develop "config subsystem aware" applications - To
help application developers start with developing with config subsystem.

[[for-operators]]
==== FOR OPERATORS

* RESTCONF/NETCONF/JMX(optional) - These interfaces can be used to
read/write data from config subsystem and thus spawn, reconfigure or
destroy Modules managed by config subsystem.
* XML/JSON - RESTCONF enables its users to read/write data using XML or
JSON, NETCONF requires usage of XML and JMX requires the use of GUI tool
such as jconsole/jvisualvm (parts of standard java JDK).

[[for-endusers]]
==== FOR ENDUSERS

Same knowledge assumed as for operators.

=== ASSUMED ENVIRONMENT

(if applicable)

[[why-do-we-have-it]]
=== WHY DO WE HAVE IT?

* pain points addressed
* problems solved

[[painpoints]]
=== PAINPOINTS

* Need a general understanding and description of the Config Subsystem.
Where to find a good description?
* What is the “Config Subsystem” and what does it do?
* Multiple ways of handling config in ODL (via Karaf and via Config
Subsystem’s XML files)
* How does Config Subsystem relate to OSGi bundle dependency resolution?
** It is not tied to it. Rather then following the whiteboard pattern,
where the consumers have to take of filtering, the service instances are
directly injected. Services are not imported from the OSGi registry, but
all services from config subsystem are published into it.
* Requires a Yang file to describe the model and an XML file to
instantiate the model
* How do the config xml files (eg, 00-netty.xml) in the
configuration/initial directory relate to the Config Subsystem?
** They are the "initial wiring of the controller". Their format is not
tie to the config subsystem, but rather to the config-netconf-persister
(e.g. the NETCONF-specific persistence module). They are read and pushed
at startup.
* What is the element in the config xml file (eg, 00-netty.xml) used
for?
** These come from NETCONF. They list the models which need to be
advertised to be present before the configuration file is attempted to
be pushed. Usually features which we reference are listed there -- so
that we do not even try to perform a reconfiguration when we know we do
not have enough ingredients.
* What is the preferred way to “inject” references into OSGi components?

1.  Define md-sal dependencies in yang file which auto-generated Module
and ModuleFactory classes. These auto-generated classes take care of the
injection.
2.  Use an Activator class
3.  Use Declarative Services with Dependency Injection using annotations
in the code (eg, @Component, @Reference)

* There is a lot of documentation that shows you how to do something.
BUT…we need documentation that describes “why” we are doing something.
When something doesn’t work, you need to understand why something was
done to figure out what the problem is.

[[how-does-it-work]]
=== HOW DOES IT WORK?

This chapter covers basic configuration and use tasks with focus on
technologies in use e.g. JMX, OSGi.

[[configuration-process]]
==== CONFIGURATION PROCESS

Configuration process contains details on application development,
Module spawning/reconfiguration process and configuration
persisting/pushing.

[[phase-1make-application-config-subsystem-aware]]
===== Phase 1:Make application config subsystem aware

First step is to get the application recognized by config subsystem.
Assuming there already is an application ready to be included into
config subsystem, these are the steps developers need to follow:

1.  Write YANG model describing the interface(in config subsystem called
service) and implementation(in config subsystem called Module) of your
application.
* These yang models might be included inside _src/main/yang_ folder of a
maven-module for an application or inside a completely separate
maven-module that will only deal with configuration for a particular
application.
* YANG model should contain the definition of one or more services and
one or more Modules for those services.
* YANG model needs to depend on _config.yang_ module provided by
_config-api_ bundle inside config subsystem, therefore depend on the
_config-api_ bundle on maven dependencies level.
* YANG model _config.yang_ defines the basic structures necessary for
the definition of new Modules and services.
2.  Configure the yang-maven-plugin in pom.xml inside maven-module
containing YANG models for config subsystem.
3.  Execute maven build process.
4.  Yang-maven-plugin with code generator from config subsystem will
generate 2 classes inside _src/main/java_ folder for each module defined
in the YANG schemas.
* _FooModuleFactory_ - Simple factory for Module classes
* _FooModule_ - JMX compatible wrapper class that wraps an instance of a
Module(could be an application or its part). Users are expected to
modify this class
* Additional classes generated in target folder which are not meant for
the developer(details in following sections) since these classes are
regenerated with every build unlike the _FooModuleFactory_ and
_FooModule_
* All generated classes are basically the binding between application
and config subsystem
5.  Implement the _createInstance()_ method inside the _FooModule_ class
to instantiate your application.
* Getters are used to retrieve the dependencies and configuration needed
for application instantiation

Note: Detailed step by step guide can be found in the education section.

[[phase-1.1-state-data-provisioning-from-modules]]
===== Phase 1.1: State data provisioning from Modules

Besides configuration and dependencies, the yang files for config
subsystem are used to model read-only state data provided from
application (e.g. statistics). Following the steps from previous phase
you need to:

1.  Implement interface _FooRuntimeMXBean_.
* Generated inside target folder
* Contains getters for state data modeled in the YANG models from
previous phase
2.  In the _createInstance()_ method inside the _FooModule_ register the
implementation of _FooRuntimeMXBean_ using injected instance of
_RootRuntimeBeanRegistrator_.

Note: This phase is entirely optional as provision of state data is
optional for modules. Note 2: It is also possible to define rpcs along
with state data in the yang schemas.

[[phase-2config-subsystem-modules-discovery]]
===== Phase 2:Config subsystem Modules discovery

After the bundles with application and config subsystem bindings are
ready, they need to be included in the ODL distribution and picked up by
config subsystem at startup. Config subsystem detects "config subsystem
aware" bundles by:

1.  Config-manager(in its activator) starts a bundle tracker and listens
to "Bundle is active" events.
* By listening on active, config subsystem is guaranteed that all the
dependencies(bundles) of a bundle are already resolved.
* If all the dependencies are resolved, all YANG model dependencies are
resolved as well, since the models are part of those
dependencies(bundles).
2.  For every new bundle it looks for generated Module factories.
* A simple text file:
_META-INF/services/org.opendaylight.controller.config.spi.ModuleFactory_
is used to find the generated Module factories
* The text files contain fully qualified names of all factories inside
the bundle
* The file is added by code generator for config subsystem within
yang-maven-plugin while generating config subsystem bindings
3.  For every new bundle it also looks for YANG models to create an
instance of a SchemaContext.
* The SchemaContext is later used to resolve configuration attributes
such as identities and also for mapping between NETCONF interface and
config subsystem
* SchemaContext is built using resources from yangtools such as:
_ModuleInfoBackedContext_ and _ModuleInfoBackedContext_
4.  Config-manager creates and stores a singleton instance of each
Module factory
* This instance will be later used to create one or more instances of
Modules
* This instance is also registered in the OSGi service registry
* Instance of _ConfigRegistry_ is responsible for managing the factories
and their instances
* _ConfigRegistry_ itself is also exposed into OSGi

[[phase-3application-instantiation]]
===== Phase 3:Application instantiation

After the distribution is fully started and all bundles scanned, it is
possible to instantiate available Modules using RESTCONF, NETCONF or
JMX.

1.  _ConfigRegistry_ is the core class of config-manager and is
responsible for transactional configuration management.
* Application instantitation is considered a configuration change.
2.  Transaction from _ConfigRegistry_ is started.
3.  New Module instance is created in the transaction (using stored
instance of Module factory for a particular Module).
4.  Attributes and dependencies are set for the new instance of the
module.
5.  Transaction resolves and validates the dependencies and also other
configuration parameters.
* Users can provide additional validation of configuration attributes
inside the generated Module class in method: _customValidation()_
* Dependencies are checked for correct dependency type in the module and
the dependency graph is searched for loops or missing dependencies
(responsibility of _DependencyResolver_ in config-manager)
6.  Transaction is committed.
* All configuration attributes and dependencies are injected into to
Module instance
* Method _createInstance()_ is called for the Module instance
* User code inside _createInstance()_ method should instantiate the
application and pass all relevant attributes and dependencies to it
* Returned instance is registered into JMX and optionally into OSGi
service registry

Note: Detailed how-to guides are included in education section. +
Note 2: Detailed overview of configuration process is also included in
education.

[[phase-4-application-reconfiguration]]
===== Phase 4: Application reconfiguration

After a Module was successfully instantiated, it can be reconfigured at
any point, the reconfiguration is very similar to instantiation:

1.  Transaction from _ConfigRegistry_ is started.
2.  The configuration of a Module identified by its type and name is
changed.
3.  New module instance is created in the transaction.
4.  Method _createInstance()_ is not called yet.
5.  Initially, method _boolean:canReuseInstance(oldModuleInstance)_
inside generated Module class is called to make the decision whether we
can reuse old instance of a Module (typically when no configuration was
changed, but this behavior can be overridden by user to modify the
default implementation)''
* The logic of reuse and new instance creation is also generated but is
located in an abstract class in the target folder. This abstract class
is the parent of Module class available to the user and its purpose is
to hide general logic common for all Modules. This abstract class
however provides some non-final methods, which can be overridden in
order to modify the default behavior e.g. reuse of instances.
6.  If old instance can be reused, then the old instance of Module is
reused and the new one is abandoned.
* The transaction can be committed at this point.
7.  If the old instance cannot be reused, then the old Module is
abandoned and its wrapped instance(the application it manages) is
closed.
* Method _createInstance()_ is called for the Module instance.
* The process continues as described in previous phase with newly
spawned instances.
* JMX registration is recreated as the new instance of Module is
registered.

[[phase-initial-configuration-push]]
===== Phase: Initial configuration push

In order to automate startup of infrastructural services, plugins and
applications, a _config-pusher_ mechanism was implemented. It is part of
a *config-persister* component and detailed documentation can be found
at: OpenDaylight_Controller:Config:Configuration:Initial[Initial
configuration for ODL] (// TODO might need an update for karaf based
distribution). +
 +
 Initial configuration push just consists of a few edit-config rpcs sent
to the northbound NETCONF interface for config subsystem. It does not
differ from a user sending edit-configs via NETCONF. The format of files
with initial configuration was chosen as XML since XML is the format of
NETCONF rpcs and allows for trivial construction of edit-config rpcs,
since the content is only copied from the files into the rpc. No
transformation is needed in such case. +
 +
_Note: The NETCONF messages with initial config are not transferred over
network, just inside the JVM_ +
 +
_' Required capabilities in files with initial config_' The whole
environment in ODL is fully dynamic as it uses OSGi container
internally. This implies the dynamic nature of config subsystem as well
as its NETCONF northbound interface. Bundles and features can appear at
any time and config subsystem needs to pick them up as they come and go.
These bundles may contain YANG models and the binding classes for config
subsystem. Before a bundle is installed and picked up, initial config
file that tries to spawn a Module defined in that bundle cannot be
pushed. Config-pusher has to wait with such config files until required
bundles are loaded. The required capabilities listed in the files ensure
this behavior as config pusher waits until NETCONF server lists the
required YANG models as capabilities. +
 *The required-capabilities in initial config files ensure that config
subsystem is ready to spawn required modules in the dynamic environment
of OSGi* +
 +
 *Config push in karaf* +
 This mechanism was slightly updated for the *Karaf* distribution.
Initial config files are not picked up from file-system but rather from
features containing bundles with initial config files. A hook for an
install feature event was implemented to scan incoming features.
_Config-persister_ is an extensible component that can be configured to
use any *storage-adapter* internally to load initial configuration and
the feature-storage-adapter was implemented in this case. +

[[phase-configuration-persisting]]
===== Phase: Configuration persisting

Besides the initial configuration push, config-persister also stores
current configuration snapshot from ODL while its running. After every
change of configuration, a notification is sent to config-persister with
current snapshot to store. Notifications are carried over JMX (JMX can
be used easily to transfer notifications). The notifications are
generated in the NETCONF interface to config subsystem not config
subsystem itself. The reason for this is that inside NETCONF interface
there already is a snapshot of current configuration in an easily
storeable and restorable format: XML. There is a disadvantage to this
approach: Changed configuration would not be stored using
config-persister in case users interact with config subsystem
directly(from code or JMX). +
 +
Stored configuration snapshot will be loaded during the next startup of
ODL. This is the mechanism to preserve the changes to the configuration
of ODL initiated by operators/users. +
 +
TODO: How does the feature-storage-adapter work with persisted
configuration ?

[[yang-in-config-subsystem]]
==== YANG IN CONFIG SUBSYSTEM

Primary interfaces for config subsystem are NETCONF and RESTCONF. These
interfaces rely on YANG modeling language to describe the data being
sent. In addition to data description/definition, YANG models are used
to generate the Modules and related config subsystem binding. +
YANG modeling language was chosen for config subsystem for 2 reasons:

1.  To fit into the ecosystem of ODL where YANG modeling language is
highly used by MD-SAL and applications/plugins.
2.  Considering ODL controller a network device, its management should
be exposed in a standardized manner. Management of ODL is handled by the
config subsystem and exposed by NETCONF and RESTCONF using YANG as data
definition language.

[[base-config-yang-models]]
===== Base Config yang models

Core models for config subsystem(defining top level constructs) are
located in *config-api* component inside config subsystem:

*
https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/controller/job/controller-merge/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/opendaylight/config/config-api/target/site/models/config.html[_config.yang_]
- this model defines following structures:
** *modules* - Top level container with a single _List_ node where list
entry = Module instance with module specific configuration and state
data. Each entry is identified by its module-type and name. Two _Choice_
nodes are used for configuration and state data. Each new module
definition then only adds new _Case_ nodes where its configuration and
state is defined.
** *services* - Top level container with a single _List_ node where list
entry = Service reference. Service reference is named reference for an
instance of a Module. These references are identified by its
service-type and name and used for dependency injection. Module
instances cannot be referenced directly as a dependency, instead a
service instance has to be used.
** *base identities* - Base identities defining module-type and
service-type identity. Identities derived from these two specify
concrete types of services nad Modules usually defined by users.
** *extensions* - Config subsystem specific extensions.
*
https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/controller/job/controller-merge/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/opendaylight/config/config-api/target/site/models/rpc-context.html[rpc-context.yang]
- constructs and extensions required in case runtime rpc invocation is
desired for Module instances.

_Note: Detailed information can be found inside the models and in the
tutorial/education section._

==== COMPONENT MAP

* Netconf subsystem contains the northbound netconf APIs for config
subsystem as well as implementation of config pusher so its also
relevant: OpenDaylight_Controller:Netconf:Component_Map[Netconf

[[how-does-it-fit-into-the-controller-architecture]]
==== HOW DOES IT FIT INTO THE CONTROLLER ARCHITECTURE?

*Config subsystem is part of infrastructure of the controller but stands
above other infrastructure services(e.g. md-sal) and running
applications(e.g. netconf-connector).* It gets activated using OSGi
Activators and there is only one instance of config subsystem per
controller node/JVM. Config-subsystem then manages the modules within
the controller (e.g. datastores, md-sal brokers, restconf northbound,
netconf southbound connectors etc.). +
 Everything in the controller that is not config subsystem should be
managed by it. An example would be md-sal(datastores, brokers etc.).
With config subsystem, it is possible to easily spawn multiple instances
of md-sal and wire them with other infrastructure services or
applications (currently we are using only one md-sal instance but
multiple instances of md-sal could be used in order to isolate/separate
concerns within a single controller node and provide different services
on top of different md-sal instances e.g. restconf).

Following diagram illustrates the position of config subsystem within
the controller (TODO probably not the best diagram, remodel):
