MD-SAL provides variation of APIs and Transfer Objects which are
compile-time generated from YANG models to allow easier development of
applications, higher type-safety during compile time and lower barrier
for incomming development.

APIs and Transfer Objects are mostly model-ignorant - users of APIs are
not required to programmatically parse and understand YANG Schema.

Transfer objects are generated using
YANG Tools:YANG to Java Mapping[YANG Tools:YANG to Java Mapping]
mapping.
