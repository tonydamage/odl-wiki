[[testing-tools]]
== Testing Tools

Currently for Testing we are using several approaches which are:

[[sal-test-model]]
=== sal-test-model

Set of YANG models used for testing, currently defined models are for:

\1. Common list pattern with augmentations - 2 level deep lists, with
various testing augmentation 2. Normal RPC test model 3. Routed RPC test
model 4. Ordering test model

[[md-sal-bindingdom-based-suite]]
=== MD-SAL Binding/DOM Based suite

This test tools are used for integration testing between DOM and Binding
Data Format, tools are exported as *test-jar* for *sal-binding-broker*.

* MD-SAL Test deployer - mostly for integration testing and legacy API
support, where fully working MD-SAL is deployed
* Set of Abstract*Test used for unit testing of MD-SAL, may be used for
unit testing of client code

:* AbstractSchemaAwareTest - test which loads yang schema from classpath
and instantiates runtime codecs

:* AbstractDataBrokerTest - test which instantiates binding broker, dom
broker and datastore

:* AbstractChangeListenerTest - variation of DataBroker test which has
possibility for simple data change event testing

[[restconf-testsuite]]
=== Restconf Testsuite

Current Restconf testing is done using JerseyTest, Mockito.

Jersey tests could be combined with Abstract*Test from MD-SAL to provide
Java-based end-to-end integration and regression testing between MD-SAL
Binding and DOM formats to Restconf XML and JSON format.

[[existing-md-sal-restconf-test-suites]]
== Existing MD-SAL / Restconf test suites

* sal-inmemory-datastore - Unit testing of inmemory datastore
* sal-binding-broker - Unit testing of binding broker implementation,
integration
* sal-binding-dom-it - Regression testing using mostly legacy APIs, with
refactoring could be updated to integratation test suite for binding to
dom in sal-binding-dom-it using sal-test-model.
