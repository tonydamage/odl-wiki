= The XSQL client is a front end GUI query builder for XSQL

It makes it easy to browse ODL installed models & their attributes,
building queries to mine ODL data store or just search the data store
for specific model instances that correspond to given criteria.

== Launching the GUI client

Inside your development env, import the sal-dom-xsql maven project under
"controller/opendaylight/md-sal/". Launch the file "QueryExecutor" as a
"Java Application" (in eclipse you just right click->run as->java
application). The GUI will load and will look as follows:

Set the IP of your ODL in the host text box and to check if you have a
connection, go to the query area and press CTRL-SPACE to try and open up
the table browser. If you have an error like in the following
screenshot, you either did not load the xsql module in karaf, your ip
address is incorrect or your ODL is behind a firewall.

If everything is loaded properly, you should see the list of tables like
the following screenshot:

You can filter the list of tables via typing a word to filter the list
of tables and then press the CTRL-SPACE to via a list of tables that
contain the string you typed like in the below screenshot, use the up
arrow or down arrow to navigate between the tables and "Enter" to select
one.

Once you selected a table, you can press the "." to open up a list of
attributes/columns in that table. Navigate and select the field the same
way you did on tables.

When you are finished adding the fields, type "from" and the client will
automatically add the tables you selected.

Now just add ";" and press Enter and the query will be executed and
displayed in the result area:
