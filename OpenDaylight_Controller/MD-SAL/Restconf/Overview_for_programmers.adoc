== Overview of the most important classes

Following part contains basic overview for programmers. Restconf uses
these base classes:

* *YangInstanceIdentifier* represents the path in the data tree.
* *ConsumerSession* is used for invoking RPCs.
* *DOMDataBroker* provides access to transaction through which it is
possible to manipulate with data in datastore.
* *SchemaContext* holds information about yang modules.
* *DOMMountPointService* returns instance of DOMMountPoint based on the
InstanceIdentifier pointing to a mount point.
* *DOMMountPoint* contains reference to SchemaContext behind the mount
point.
* *DataSchemaNode* contains information about the schema node.
* *NormalizedNode* common parent of
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Controller:MD-SAL:Design:Normalized_DOM_Model[all
classes] which are used for holding data described by YANG.
* **SimpleNode* has name as the schema node, and contains the value
representing the data node value.
* **CompositeNode* can contain CompositeNode-s and SimpleNode-s.

* - will be completely removed from system (replaced with
NormalizedNode)

[[get-in-action]]
== GET in action

The first picture shows the GET operation with URI restconf/config/M:N
where M is the module name and N is the node name. +
image:Get.png[GET operation with URI restconf/config/M:N where M is
module name and N is node
name.,title="fig:GET operation with URI restconf/config/M:N where M is module name and N is node name."] +
# The requested URI is translated into the InstanceIdentifier which
points to the data node. During this translation,the DataSchemaNode that
conforms to the data node is obtained. If the data node is behind the
mount point the MountInstance is obtained as well.

1.  Restconf asks for the value of the data node from DataBrokerService
based on InstanceIdentifier.
2.  DataBrokerService returns CompositeNode as data.
3.  StructuredDataToXmlProvider or StructuredDataToJsonProvider is
called based on the Accept field from http request. These two providers
can transform CompositeNode regarding to DataSchemaNode to an XML or
JSON document.
4.  XML or JSON is returned as the answer on the request from the
client.

[[put-in-action]]
== PUT in action

The second picture shows the PUT operation with URI restconf/config/M:N
where M is the module name and N is the node name. Data is sent in the
request either in the XML or JSON format. image:Put.png[PUT operation
with URI restconf/config/M:N where M is the module name and N is the
node name. Data is sent in the request either in the XML or JSON
format.,title="fig:PUT operation with URI restconf/config/M:N where M is the module name and N is the node name. Data is sent in the request either in the XML or JSON format."]

1.  Input data is sent to JsonToCompositeNodeProvider or
XmlToCompositeNodeProvider. the correct provider is selected based on
the Content-Type field from the http request. These two providers can
transform input data to CompositeNode. However, this CompositeNode does
not contain enough information for transactions.
2.  the requested URI is translated into InstanceIdentifier which points
to the data node. DataSchemaNode conforming to the data node is obtained
during this translation. If the data node is behind the mount point, the
MountInstance is obtained as well.
3.  CompositeNode can be normalized by adding additional information
from DataSchemaNode.
4.  Restconf begins transaction and puts CompositeNode with
InstanceIdentifier into it. The response on the request from the client
is the status code which depends on the result from the transaction.
