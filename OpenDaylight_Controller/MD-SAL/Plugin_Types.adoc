* *Southbound Protocol Plugin* - component which is responsible for
handling multiple sessions to southbound network devices and providing
common abstracted interface to access various type of functionality
provided by these network devices.
* *Manager-type Application* - component which is responsible for
managing state and configuration of particular functionality which is
exposed by southbound protocol plugins
* *Protocol Library* - component which is responsible for handling
serialization/deserialization between wire protocol format and Java form
of protocol
* *Connector Plugin* - component which is responsible for connecting
consumers (and providers) to Model-driven SAL (and other components) via
different wire protocol or set of APIs

Each of this component types exposes different models, uses different
subset of MD-SAL functionality and differs in complexity.

[[southbound-protocol-plugin]]
== Southbound Protocol Plugin

Southbound Protocol Plugin is responsible for handling multiple sessions
to southbound network devices and providing common abstracted interface
to access various type of functionality provided by these network
devices.

Southbound Protocol Plugin should be:

* *Stateless* - only preserved state (which is still transient) is list
of connected devices / sessions
* Models mostly use RPCs and Notifications to describe plugin
functionality

Example plugins:

* Openflow Southbound Plugin
* Netconf Southbound Plugin
* BGP Southbound Plugin
* PCEP Southbound Plugin

[[manager-type-application]]
== Manager-type Application

Manager-type Applications are responsible for providing
configuration-like functionality to set / modify behaviour of network
elements or southbound plugins, coordinate flows and provide higher
logic on top of stateless southbound plugins.

Manager-type Applications:

* Preserves state
* Models mostly use Configuration Data and Runtime Data to describe
component functionality
