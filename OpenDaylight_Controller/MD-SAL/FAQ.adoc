[[q-1-what-is-the-overall-md-sal-architecture]]
===== Q-1: What is the overall MD-SAL architecture?

:* *What is the overall architecture, components, and functionality?*

:* *Who supplies which components, and how are the components plumbed?*

*A-1:*

::
  The overall Model-Driven SAL (MD-SAL) architecture did not really
  change from the API-Driven SAL (AD-SAL). As with the AD-SAL, plugins
  can be data providers, or data consumers, or both (although the AD-SAL
  did not explicitly name them as such). Just like the AD-SAL, the
  MD-SAL connects data consumers to appropriate data providers and
  (optionally) facilitates data adaptation between them.

::
  Now, in the AD-SAL, the SAL APIs request routing between consumers and
  providers, and data adaptations are all statically defined at compile
  or build time. In the MD-SAL, the SAL APIs and request routing between
  consumers and providers are defined from models, and data adaptations
  are provided by 'internal' adaptation plugins. The API code is
  generated from models when a plugin is compiled. When the plugin OSGI
  bundle is loaded into the controller, the API code is loaded into the
  controller along with the rest of the plugin containing the model.

::
  The AD-SAL and the MD-SAL are shown side-by-side in the following
  figure:

image:SAL-Comparison.png[SAL-Comparison.png,title="SAL-Comparison.png"]

::
  The AD-SAL provides request routing (selects an SB plugin based on
  service type), and optionally, provides service adaptation, if an NB
  (Service, abstract) API is different from its corresponding SB
  (protocol) API. For example, in the above figure, the AD-SAL routes
  requests from NB-Plugin 1 to SB Plugins 1 and 2. Note that the plugin
  SB and NB APIs in this example are essentially the same (although both
  of them need to be defined). Request routing is based on the plugin
  type: the SAL knows which node instance is served by which plugin.
  When an NB Plugin requests an operation on a given node, the request
  is routed to the appropriate plugin which then routes the request to
  the appropriate node. The AD-SAL can also provide service abstractions
  and adaptations. For example, in the above figure, NB Plugin 2 is
  using an abstract API to access the services provided by SB Plugins 1
  and 2. The translation between the SB Plugin API and the abstract NB
  API is done in the Abstraction module in the AD-SAL.

::
  The MD-SAL provides request routing and the infrastructure to support
  service adaptation. However, it does not provide service adaptation
  itself: service adaptation is provided by plugins. From the point of
  view of MD-SAL, the Adaptation Plugin is a regular plugin. It provides
  data to the SAL, and consumes data form the SAL through APIs generated
  from models. An Adaptation Plugin basically performs model-to-model
  translations between two APIs. Request Routing in the MD-SAL is done
  on both protocol type and node instances, since node instance data is
  exported from the plugin into the SAL (the model data contains routing
  information).

::
  The simplest MD-SAL APIs generated from models (RPCs and
  Notifications, both supported in the yang modeling language) are
  functionally equivalent to AD-SAL function call APIs. Additionally,
  the MD-SAL can store data for models defined by plugins. Provider and
  consumer plugins can exchange data through the MD-SAL storage (more
  details in later sections). Data in the MD-SAL is accessed through
  getter and setter APIs generated from models. Note that this is in
  contrast to the AD-SAL, which is stateless.

::
  Note that in the above figure, both NB AD-SAL Plugins provide REST
  APIs to the controller client applications.

::
  The functionality provided by the MD-SAL is basically to facilitate
  the plumbing between providers and consumers. A provider or a consumer
  can register itself with the MD-SAL. A consumer can find a provider
  that it is interested in. A provider can generate notifications; a
  consumer can receive notifications and issue RPCs to get data from
  providers. A provider can insert data into SAL’s storage; a consumer
  can read data from SAL’s storage.

::
  Note that the structure of SAL APIs in the MD-SAL is different from
  that in the AD-SAL. The AD-SAL typically has both NB and SB APIs even
  for functions or services that are mapped 1:1 between SB Plugins and
  NB Plugins. For example, in the current AD-SAL implementation of the
  OpenFlow Plugin and applications, the NB SAL APIs used by OF
  applications are mapped 1:1 onto SB OF Plugin APIs. The MD-SAL allows
  both the NB plugins and SB plugins to use the same API generated from
  a model. One plugin becomes an API (service) provider; the other
  becomes an API (service) consumer. This eliminates the need to define
  two different APIs and to provide three different implementations even
  for the cases where the APIs are mapped to each other 1:1. The MD SAL
  provides instance-based request routing between multiple provider
  plugins.

[[q-2-what-functionality-does-the-md-sal-assume-for-example-does-the-sal-assume-that-the-network-model-is-a-part-of-the-sal]]
===== Q-2: What functionality does the MD-SAL assume? For example, does
the SAL assume that the network model is a part of the SAL?

*A-2:*

::
  The MD-SAL does not assume any model. All models are provided by the
  plugins. The MD-SAL only provides the infrastructure and the plumbing
  for the plugins.

[[q-3-what-is-a-day-in-the-life-of-an-md-sal-plugin]]
===== Q-3: What is a "day in the life" of an MD-SAL plugin?

[[a-3]]
====== A-3:

::
  All plugins (protocol, application, adaptation, and others) have the
  same life-cycle. The life of a plugin has two distinct phases: design
  and operation.

::
  During the design phase, the plugin designer performs the following
  actions:
  +
  * The designer decides which data will be consumed by the plugin and
  imports the SAL APIs generated from the models of the API provider.
  Note that the topology model is just one possible data type that may
  be consumed by a plugin. The list of currently available data models
  and their APIs can be found in YANG_Tools:Available_Models.
  * The designer decides which data and how will be provided by the
  plugin and designs the data model for the provided data. The data
  model (expressed in yang) is then run through the link:YANG_Tools[yang
  tools], which generate the SAL APIs for the model.
  * The implementations for the generated consumer and provider APIs,
  along with other plugin features and functionality, are developed. The
  resulting code is packaged in a “plugin” OSGI bundle. Note that a
  developer may package the code of a subsystem in multiple plugins or
  applications that may communicate with each other through the SAL.
  * The generated APIs and a set of helper classes are also built and
  packaged in an “API” OSGI bundle.

[[a-3-i-plugin-development-process]]
====== A-3: (i) Plugin Development Process

::
  The plugin development process is shown in the following figure.

image:Plugin_design_process.png[Plugin_design_process.png,title="Plugin_design_process.png"]

::
  When the OSGI bundle of a plugin is loaded into the controller and
  activated, the operation phase begins. The plugin operation is
  probably best explained with a few examples describing the operation
  of the OF Protocol plugin and OF applications, such as the Flow
  Programmer Service, the ARP Handler, or the Topology Manager.

[[a-3-ii-flow-deleted-notification-scenario]]
====== A-3: (ii) "Flow Deleted" notification scenario

::
  The following figure shows a scenario where a “Flow Deleted”
  notification from a switch arrives at the controller.

image:Flow_Deleted_use_case.png[Flow_Deleted_use_case.png,title="Flow_Deleted_use_case.png"]

::
  The scenario is as follows:
  +
  1.  The Flow Programmer Service registers with the MD SAL for the
  “Flow Deleted” notification. This is done when the controller and its
  plugins or applications are started.
  2.  A “Flow Deleted” OF packet arrives at the controller. The OF
  Library receives the packet on the TCP/TLS connection to the switch
  that is sending and passes it to the OF Plugin.
  3.  The OF Plugin parses the packet and uses the parsed data to create
  a “Flow Deleted” SAL notification. The notification is actually an
  immutable “Flow Deleted” Data Transfer Object (DTO) that is created or
  populated by means of methods from the model-generated OF Plugin API.
  4.  The OF Plugin sends the “Flow Deleted” SAL notification
  (containing the notification DTO) into the SAL. The SAL routes the
  notification to registered consumers, in this case, the Flow
  Programmer Service.
  5.  The Flow Programmer Service receives the notification containing
  the notification DTO.
  6.  The Flow Programmer Service uses methods from the model-generated
  OF Plugin API to get the data from the immutable notification DTO
  received in Step 5. The processing is the same as in the AD-SAL.

::
  Note that other packet-in scenarios, where a switch punts a packet to
  the controller, such as an ARP or an LLDP packet, are similar.
  Interested apps register for the respective notifications. The OF
  plugin generates the notification from the received OF packets, and
  sends them to the SAL. The SAL routes the notifications to the
  registered recipients.

[[a-3-iii-add-flow-scenario-via-nb-rest-api-invocation]]
====== A-3: (iii) "Add Flow" scenario via NB REST API invocation

::
  The following figure shows a scenario where an external application
  adds a flow by means of the NB REST API of the controller.

image:Add_Flow_use_case.png[Add_Flow_use_case.png,title="Add_Flow_use_case.png"]

::
  The scenario is as follows:
  +
  1.  Registrations are performed when the controller and its plugins or
  applications are started. a)The Flow Programmer Service registers with
  the MD SAL for Flow configuration data notifications, and b) The OF
  Plugin registers (among others) the ‘AddFlow’ RPC implementation with
  the SAL. Note that the RPC is defined in the OF Plugin model, and that
  the API is generated during build time.
  2.  A client application requests a flow add through the REST API of
  the controller. (Note that in the AD-SAL, there is a dedicated NB REST
  API on top of the Flow Programming Service. The MD-SAL provides a
  common infrastructure where data and functions defined in models can
  be accessed by means of a common REST API. For more information, see
  http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-bierman-netconf-restconf/). The
  client application provides all parameters for the flow in the REST
  call.
  3.  Data from the ‘Add Flow’ request is deserialized, and a new flow
  is created in the Flow Service configuration data tree. (Note that in
  this example, the configuration and operational data trees are
  separated; this may be different for other services). Note also that
  the REST call returns success to the caller as soon as the flow data
  is written to the configuration data tree.
  4.  Since the Flow Programmer Service is registered to receive
  notifications for data changes in the Flow Service data tree, the
  MD-SAL generates a ‘data changed’ notification to the Flow Programmer
  Service.
  5.  The Flow Programmer Service reads the newly added flow, and
  performs a flow add operation (which is basically the same as in the
  AD-SAL).
  6.  At some point during the flow addition operation, the Flow
  Programmer Service needs to tell the OF Plugin to add the flow in the
  appropriate switch. The Flow Programmer Service uses the OF Plugin
  generated API to create the RPC input parameter DTO for the “AddFlow”
  RPC of the OF Plugin.
  7.  The Flow Programmer Service gets the service instance (actually, a
  proxy), and invokes the “AddFlow” RPC on the service. The MD-SAL will
  route the request to the appropriate OF Plugin (which implements the
  requested RPC).
  8.  The “AddFlow” RPC request is routed to the OF Plugin, and the
  implementation method of the “AddFlow” RPC is invoked.
  9.  The “AddFlow” RPC implementation uses the OF Plugin API to read
  values from the DTO of the RPC input parameter. (Note that the
  implementation will use the getter methods of the DTO generated from
  the yang model of the RPC to read the values from the received DTO.)
  10. The "AddFlow" RPC is further processed (pretty much the same as in
  the AD-SAL) and at some point, the corresponding flowmod is sent to
  the corresponding switch.

[[q-4-is-there-a-document-that-describes-how-code-is-generated-from-the-models-for-the-md-sal]]
===== Q-4: Is there a document that describes how code is generated from
the models for the MD-SAL?

*A-4:*

::
  Yangtools documents the Yang to Java generation:
  YANG_Tools:YANG_to_Java_Mapping, including examples of how the yang
  constructs are mapped onto Java classes. You can write unit tests
  against the generated code. You will have to write the implementations
  of the generated RPC interfaces. The generated code is just Java, and
  it debugs just like Java.

::
  If you want to play with generating Java from Yang there is a Maven
  archetype to help you get going: Maven_Archetypes:odl-model-project.

::
  Or, you can try creating a project in Eclipse as explained at:
  http://sdntutorials.com/yang-to-java-conversion-how-to-create-maven-project-in-eclipse/[How
  to create Maven project in Eclipse].

[[q-5-the-code-generation-tools-mention-producers-and-consumers.-how-are-these-related-to-southbound-and-northbound-sal-plugins]]
===== Q-5: The code generation tools mention 'producers' and
'consumers'. How are these related to 'southbound' and 'northbound SAL
plugins?

*A-5*:

::
  The difference between southbound and northbound plugins is that the
  southbound plugins talk protocols to network nodes and northbound
  plugins talk application APIs to the controller applications. As far
  as the SAL is concerned, there is really no north or south. The SAL is
  basically a data exchange and adaptation mechanism between plugins.
  The plugin SAL roles (consumer or producer) are defined with respect
  to the data being moved around or stored by the SAL. A producer
  implements an API and provides the data of the API: a consumer uses
  the API and consumes the data of the API.

::
  While 'northbound' and 'southbound' provide the view of the SAL of a
  network engineer, 'consumer' and 'producer' provide the view of the
  SAL of a software engineer, and is shown in the following figure:

OpenDaylight?

[[q-8-where-can-i-find-sal-example-code]]
===== Q-8: Where can I find SAL example code?

*A-8*:

::
  We provided a simple complete example of a model, a service provider
  (toaster) and a service consumer in the toaster sample. It provides
  the model of a programmable toaster, a sample consumer application
  that uses MD-SAL APIs, a sample southbound plugin (a service provider)
  that implements toaster, and a unit test suite.

::
  The toaster example is in _controller.git_ under
  _opendaylight/md-sal/samples_.

[[q-9-where-is-the-rest-api-code-for-the-example]]
===== Q-9: Where is the REST API code for the example?

*A-9*:

::
  The REST APIs will be derived from models. You do not have to write
  any code for it. The controller will implement the
  http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-bierman-netconf-restconf/[RESTCONF]
  protocol which defines access to yang-formatted data through REST.
  Basically, all you need to do is define your service in a model, and
  expose that model to the SAL. REST access to your modeled data will
  then be provided by the SAL infrastructure. However, if you want to,
  you can create your own REST API (for example, to be compliant with an
  existing API).
