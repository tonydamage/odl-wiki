There are 2 kinds of messaging exchange pattern supported by MD-SAL

1.  Request/Reply
2.  Publish/Subscribe

Request/Reply pattern is implemented by rpc module. Publish/Subscribe
functionality is provided by notification module. The implementation
details are provided on this page:
OpenDaylight_Controller:MD-SAL:Explained:Messaging_Patterns

This wiki only focuses on Publish/Subscribe implementation. Pre-helium
implementation assumes a single vm deployment of controller. The message
exchange happens only within a VM in memory. The requirement for helium
is to enable these notifications across nodes in the cluster.

There are 2 kinds of Publish/Subscribe notifications:

1.  Data Change events
2.  Yang notifications

In both cases, the notifications are broadcasted to all "listeners".

[[requirement]]
= Requirement

A lot has been discussed on the thread
https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/controller-dev/2014-July/005923.html[here]

* We should be able to publish notifications to any subscriber in the
cluster.

* Subscribers should be able to specify delivery policy
** 1 of N - Deliver the notification to any one of N instances of
application running in the cluster
** N of N - Broadcase
** Local only - The events generated on the same node as the application
instance
** Load Balance - Round robin, least loaded etc
** Content Based or any other application specified custom logic

* Publisher should be able to attach properties to the message
** Message priority
** Delivery guarantee ?

* Ability to plug-in external systems such as AMQP based systems ? Not
sure if this is a requirement but was discussed on the mailing thread.

[[proposal]]
= Proposal

Based on the requirement, a change in API has been proposed.

`
  '''Yang notification'''
  publish(Notification notification, ''MessageProperties props'');
  registerNotificationListener(org.opendaylight.yangtools.yang.binding.NotificationListener.NotificationListener listener, ''Selector selector'');
  registerNotificationListener(Class notificationType, org.opendaylight.controller.sal.binding.api.NotificationListener listener, ''Selector selector'');

  '''Data change notification'''
  registerDataChangeListener(LogicalDatastoreType store, P path, L listener, DataChangeScope triggeringScope, "Selector selector");

`

`
 public interface MessageProperties{
  public Priority priority();
  ...[add more properties]
 }
`

`
 public enum Priority { HIGH, NORMAL, LOW};
`

`
 public interface Selector {
  public List<InstanceLocator> select(Notification event, List<InstanceLocator> instances);
 }
`

`'Selector"` and `"MessageProperties"` are new additions.

Now the question is about the behavior of current APIs without
`'Selector"` and `"MessageProperties"`. As far as message priority goes,
its easy, we assign `normal`. The tricky one is deliver policy. Should
the message be delivered to all instances of the application in the
cluster or just one? While there is no consensus on this yet, the
proposal is:

`* Data change notifications are delivered only to subscribers on shard manager` +
`* Yang notifications are only delivered to subscribers local to the node where notification was generated` +
`* For message deliver, at this time we only intend to support `*`at-once`*` semantics`

[[components]]
== Components

Clustering solutions is based on Akka. For clustering of notifications,
we'll use Akka's Actor system. We'll have following components in the
system:

image:DistributedNotifications.png[DistributedNotifications.png,title="fig:DistributedNotifications.png"] +
*NotificationProviderService* - MD-SAL interface that notification
broker must implement.

*NotificationBrokerImpl* - Implementation of
NotificationProviderService. It maintains local state of subscriptions.
It uses `DistributedPubSubProxy` to publish events or send subscription
information that needs to be shared cluster wide.

*DistributedPubSubProxy* - An interface to define contract for
distributed pub/sub.

*AkkaPubSubBrokerProxy* - Implementation of `DistributedPubSubProxy`
interface. It uses Akka's Actor System to exchange messages across nodes
in the cluster.

*AmqpPubSubProxy* - While we dont intend to build this, any 3rd party
system can be plugged in by implementing `DistributedPubSubProxy`.

*AkkaPubSubActor* - Its the main class that does the work of messaging
across nodes.

* It uses `GlobalSubscriptionRegistry` to route published messages or
add/update/delete subscriptions.
* It uses `MessageDispatcher` to send messages to another node.
`MessageDispatchers` are a bunch of actors sharing a common mailbox.
* It uses
http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/snapshot/scala/mailboxes.html[priority
mailbox] to prioritize event processing.

*GlobalSubscriptionRegistry* - Global state used by AkkaPubSubBroker. To
globally share the state across nodes in the cluster,
SubscriptionRegistry will use gossip protocol following eventually
consistent model. +
Every node in the cluster will keep a "bucket" in the registry where it
and only it will be responsible to update. The buckets will be versioned
and hold subscription information.

*MessageDispatchers* - These are actors that are responsible for
serializing and transmitting data to other nodes in the cluster. They
use a separate execution context (i.e thread pool) than
`AkkaPubSubActor`. This is to ensure serialization and message dispatch
processing time does not come in the way of `AkkaPubSubActor`. +
`MessageDispatchers` create a `MessageEnvelope` that contains
`Notification` and a list of subscribers to deliver the notification to.
There's one envelop created per node. +
`MessageDispatchers` could be

* a simple (`'''SimpleMessageDispatcher'''`) or
* reliable (`'''ReliableMessageDispatcher'''`) -
`ReliableMessageDispatchers` may implement
http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/contrib/reliable-proxy.html[reliable
proxy pattern], store-and-forward or any other mechanism to ensure the
level of guarantee needed.

*MessageEnvelope* - Contains the notification and a list of subscriber
to whom this notification needs to be delivered.
