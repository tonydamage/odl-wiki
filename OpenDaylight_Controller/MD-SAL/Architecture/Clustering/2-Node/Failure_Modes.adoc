= Overview = This page documents the various Failover (FO) and Failback
(FB) scenarios for
OpenDaylight_Controller:MD-SAL:Architecture:Clustering:2-Node[2-Node]
(Active-Active and Active-Passive)
OpenDaylight_Controller:MD-SAL:Architecture:Clustering:2-Node#Deployment_Modes[cluster
deployments].

[[guidelines]]
== Guidelines

The test scenarios below follow these guidelines:

* Diagrams are based on recommended
OpenDaylight_Controller:MD-SAL:Architecture:Clustering:2-Node#recommended_Topology[Recommended
2-Node Cluster Topology].
* The Healthy 2-Node cluster diagram is the condition of the cluster
before each Failover scenario.
* Only failures that result in a change in Role: _\{Primary,
Secondary}_, Raft State: _\{Candidate, Follower, Leader}_, or denied
operation are shown.
* Failover Diagrams show the resulting state of the cluster for a given
scenario.
* Failback scenarios start with the corresponding numbered Failover
condition and describe the ways the cluster can recover.

=== Config Changes ===

*AA_CFG-1a)* (No Failures Occurring) Change *configuredPrimary* to
Controller B.  +
:*Result:* Controller B is the Full Primary of the network.

 +
*AA_CFG-1b)* (Network Partition) Changing *configuredPrimary* to
Controller B.  +
:*Result:* Deny config change. Each controller is still a Partial
Primary of its network segment.

 +
*AA_CFG-1c)* (Controller B Fail-Stopped) Changing *configuredPrimary* to
Controller B.  +
:*Result:* Deny config change. Controller A is the Full Primary of the
network.

 +
*AA_CFG-2a)* (No Failures Occurring) Controller B is Current Full
Primary - Changing _*failbackToPrimary*_ to TRUE.  +
:*Result:* Controller A is the Full Primary of the network.

*AA_CFG-2b)* (Network Partition) Controller B is Current Full Primary -
Changing _*failbackToPrimary*_ to TRUE.  +
:*Result:* Deny config change. Each controller is still a Partial
Primary of its network segment.

*AA_CFG-2c)* (Controller A Fail-Stopped) Controller B is Current Full
Primary - Changing _*failbackToPrimary*_ to TRUE.  +

the network.
