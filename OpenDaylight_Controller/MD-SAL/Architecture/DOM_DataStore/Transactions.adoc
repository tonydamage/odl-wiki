[[data-store-read-operation]]
== Data Store Read Operation

The data store read operation is shown in the following figure:

image:DS-Data-Read-OP.jpg[DS-Data-Read-OP.jpg,title="DS-Data-Read-OP.jpg"]

The sequence is as follows:

1.  baDataBroker.readOperationalData(yang.binding.InstanceIdentifier)
2.  connector.readOperationalData(...)
3.  domInstanceIdentifier =
mappingService.toDataDom(bindingInstanceIdentifier)
4.  biDataBroker.readOperationalData(domInstanceIdentifier)
5.  domData = dataStore.readOperationalData(domInstanceIdentifier)
6.  domData is returned to caller
7.  domData is returned to caller
8.  baData = mappingService.toDataObject (bindingInstanceIdentifier,
domData)
9.  baData is returned to caller
10. baData is returned to caller
11. baData is returned to caller

= Transaction-Based Operation

[[create-a-ba-to-dom-transaction]]
== Create a BA-to-DOM Transaction

First a transaction object needs to be created, as shown in the
following sequence:

image:DS-Create-Tx.jpg[DS-Create-Tx.jpg,title="DS-Create-Tx.jpg"]

The sequence is as follows:

1.  baDataBroker.beginTransaction()
2.  connector.beginForwardedTransaction()
3.  biDataBroker.beginTransaction()
4.  storeTx = dataStore.beginTransaction() // storeTx contains snapshot
5.  storeTx is returned to caller
6.  domTx = createDomTx(storeTx)
7.  return domTx to caller
8.  baDomTx = createForwardedTransaction(domTx)
9.  Return baDomTx to ForwardedDataBroker
10. Return baDomTx to client
11. Return baDomTx to client

[[data-read-operation-on-a-transaction]]
== Data Read Operation on a Transaction

An application can issue multiple reads on a previously created
transaction, as shown in the following sequence:

image:DS-Data-Read-Tx.jpg[DS-Data-Read-Tx.jpg,title="DS-Data-Read-Tx.jpg"]

The sequence is as follows:

1.  baDomTx.readOperationalData(yang.binding.InstanceIdentifier)
2.  // lookup in local cache, asume fail – performance optimalization
3.  domInstanceIdentifier =
mappingService.toDataDom(bindingInstanceIdentifier)
4.  domTx.readOperationalData(domInstanceIdentifier)
5.  domData = storeTx.readOperationalData(domInstanceIdentifier)
6.  domData is returned to caller
7.  domData is returned to caller
8.  baData = mappingService.toDataDom(bindingInstanceIdentifier,
domData)
9.  baData is returned to caller
10. baData is returned to caller
11. baData is returned to caller

[[cancel-a-transaction]]
== Cancel a Transaction

An application can cancel a transaction. A transaction is cancelled, for
example, if all operations on the transaction were read.

image:DS-Cancel-Tx.jpg[DS-Cancel-Tx.jpg,title="DS-Cancel-Tx.jpg"]

The sequence is as follows:

1.  baDomTx.cancel()
2.  baDomTx clean ups all local state (cache of DTO, references to
services)
3.  domTx.cancel()
4.  dataBroker.cancel(domTx)
5.  domTx clean ups all local state (cache of DTO, references to
services)
6.  storeTx.cancel() // Asynchronous – need to keep track of
7.  storeTx clean ups all local state (modifications, snapshot)

[[data-write-operation-on-a-transaction]]
== Data Write Operation on a Transaction

In additions to reads, an application can issue multiple writes on a
previously created transaction, as shown in the following sequence:

image:DS-Data-Write-Tx.jpg[DS-Data-Write-Tx.jpg,title="DS-Data-Write-Tx.jpg"]

The sequence is as follows:

1.  baDomTx.putOperationalData(yang.binding.InstanceIdentifier,Node)
2.  // Cache cleanup of subtree and parent nodes
3.  domII,domData =
mappingService.toDataDom(bindingInstanceIdentifier,baData)
4.  domTx.putOperationalData(domInstanceIdentifier,domData)
5.  storeTx.replaceData(domInstanceIdentifier,domData)
6.  storeTx updates modification index

[[transaction-commit]]
== Transaction Commit

The commit operation is shown in the following sequence:

image:DS-Commit-Tx.jpg[DS-Commit-Tx.jpg,title="DS-Commit-Tx.jpg"]

The sequence is as follows:

1.  baDomTx.commit() // Submits to commit queue
2.  domTx.commit()
3.  dataBroker.commit(domTx)
4.  Start of two Phase commit – requestCommit on Commit Handlers
5.  storeTx.requestCommit() // Asynchronous – need to keep track of
6.  storeTx creates optimistic snapshot
7.  dataTx returns goAhead
8.  End of Two phace commit – finish callback on Commit Handlers
9.  storeTx.finish()
10. dataStore.finish(storeTx)
11. dataStore replaces snapshot
