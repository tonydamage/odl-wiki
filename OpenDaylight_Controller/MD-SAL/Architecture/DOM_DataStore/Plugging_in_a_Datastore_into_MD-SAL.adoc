A Data Store can be plugged into the MD-SAL in two ways:

* Implement the SAL Core SPI and use functionality (e.g. transactions)
of the existing DOM Data Broker implementation.
* Implement the SAL Core API and replace the existing DOM Data Broker
with its own, Data Store specific implementation.

The SAL Core SPI and SAL Core API are shown in the following figure:

The SAL Core SPI is defined in
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/5604/.

The SAL Core API types are defined in
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/5613/.

The SAL Core API is defined in
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/5595/.
