== AD-SAL Overview

AD-SAL is a flavor of the Service Abstraction Layer created for the
Controller project, whose task is primarily to create a layer against
which the applications can be developed without assuming the underlying
SDN protocol it's talking about. The logic has been created when there
has been a need to control two different type of network elements in an
SDN fashion, meaning by accessing them in a programmatic way. It was
clear that irrespective of the different types of network element
certain things would still be applicable, practical and simple examples
are:

* Given a Network Element i want to know who my neighbors are and build
the network graph
* Given a Network Element i want to know what interfaces are attached to
it and what properties they carry
* etc .....

Starting from this assumption that certain aspects of the SDN protocols
would anyway be common no matter what the actual protocol is doing
underneath prompted for the idea those aspects could be described in a
generic way via a Java Contract (usually a set of Java Interfaces and
supporting Objects that represent the data). This way of creating
contracts that allows a consumer of the contract to be insulated by the
possible implementation is rather common in the Java world, where for
example there are contracts like:

* https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=315[Servlet 3.0]
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jax-rs[JAX-RS]

which are described by a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Specification_Request[JSR] (Java
Specification Request) which then can be implemented by different
providers. For example Servlet 3.0 contracts could be implemented by
Tomcat or Jetty or other servlet container. By going by the same analogy
the protocol plugins (i.e. the components that can understand an SDN
protocol and convert to the common layer) can implement one or more of
these contracts based on the capabilities. The Service Abstraction Layer
defined in AD-SAL is just an adaptation layer to enable the protocol
plugins to speak common aspects but only if they can do it. The service
abstraction layer in fact doesn't force a lowest common denominator for
all to be spoken, but rather given a certain aspect if the protocol
plugins supports it it will be supported in a common fashion. Lets take
as example the picture below:
image:MultiProtocol_ADSAL.png[MultiProtocol_ADSAL.png,title="fig:MultiProtocol_ADSAL.png"]

In the picture there are 4 types of contracts, identified by the colored
triangles, and there are 3 protocol plugins that provide implementation
for those contracts. For example the Topology contract (the one used to
learn the network graph) is implemented by all of the protocol plugins,
as expected, while the "Bridge Configuration" contract is only
implemented by OVSDB because the others are not capable of it. That is
perfectly fine and actually expected because that allows not to revert
to the lowest common denominator feature of all the protocol plugins.
Now an application when trying to use a service on a given network
element has to expect that a given contract may not be there, because
protocol plugin cannot create stuff don't exist, but this allows to
seamlessly plug in protocol plugins that implement a given contract and
application would be able to leverage it due to the fact that they have
been already programmed to understand it. The picture below explains how
an application has to deal with the optional presence of a contract on a
given network element:
image:Application dealing with ADSAL Contracts.png[Application dealing with ADSAL Contracts.png,title="fig:Application dealing with ADSAL Contracts.png"]

In picture above an application is trying to create a bridge on Nodes
O1, O2 and OF1, the first two are capable of that contract, the third
one is not, so the application has to take care of it and handle the
return code.

[[summary]]
== Summary

In summary AD-SAL is just enforcing that the protocol plugins speak a
common language for words that can be expressed in a common language.
The dictionary of the common language is not hardcoded, it can be
extended supplying new contracts to ADSAL such that new protocols plugin
can implement it and applications can consume them.
