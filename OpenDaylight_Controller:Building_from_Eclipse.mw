*opendaylight-assembleit-fast.launch                => To build only the selected resource (Project / Bundle).
*opendaylight-assembleit-noclean.launch        => to build all the bundles but skip the clean operation.
*opendaylight-assembleit-skiput.launch            => to build all the bundles but skip Unit Tests
*opendaylight-assembleit-sonar.launch             => to build all the bundles and execute Sonar (Code-Coverage, Static-Analysis tool).

*opendaylight-sonar.launch                                 => Launch a full Sonar job.

The following are PDE build specifics. 
If you are not using PDE for your build, you can safely ignore these.
*opendaylight.target                                            => PDE Target platform for remote P2 site (built by Jenkins during every merge operation).
*opendaylight-osgi-launcher.launch                 => To launch the controller skipping the assembly phase 
*opendaylight-local.target                                   => PDE for local P2 site.
*opendaylight-osgi-launcher-local.launch        => Launcher for the local target above.
