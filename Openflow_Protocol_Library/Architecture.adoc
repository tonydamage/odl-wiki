[[public-api-openflow-protocol-api]]
== Public API (openflow-protocol-api)

Set of interfaces and builders for immutable data transfer objects
representing Openflow Protocol structures.

Transfer objects and service APIs are infered from several YANG models
using code generator to reduce verbosity of definition and repeatibility
of code.

The following YANG modules are defined:

* openflow-types - defines common Openflow specific types
* openflow-instruction - defines base Openflow instructions
* openflow-action - defines base Openflow actions
* openflow-augments - defines object augmentations
* openflow-extensible-match - defines Openflow OXM match
* openflow-protocol - defines Openflow Protocol messages
* system-notifications - defines system notification objects
* openflow-configuration - defines structures used in ConfigSubsystem

This modules also reuse types from following YANG modules:

* ietf-inet-types - IP adresses, IP prefixes, IP-protocol related types
* ietf-yang-types - Mac Address, etc.

The use of predefined types is to make APIs contracts more safe, better
readable and documented (e.g using MacAddress instead of byte array...)

[[tcp-channel-pipeline-openflow-protocol-impl]]
== TCP Channel pipeline (openflow-protocol-impl)

Creates channel processing pipeline based on configuration and support.

[[switch-connection-provider]]
=== Switch Connection Provider

Implementation of connection point for other projects. Library exposes
its functionality through this class. +
Library can be configured, started and shutdowned here. There are also
methods for custom (de)serializer registration.

[[tcp-connection-initializer]]
=== Tcp Connection Initializer

In order to initialize TCP connection to a device (switch), OF Plugin
calls method initiateConnection() in SwitchConnectionProvider. This
method in turn initializes (Bootstrap) server side channel towards the
device.

[[tcp-handler]]
=== TCP Handler

Represents single server that is handling incoming connections over TCP
/ TLS protocol. +
TCP Handler creates a single instance of TCP Channel Initializer that
will initialize channels. After that it binds to configured InetAddress
and port. When a new device connects, TCP Handler registers its channel
and passes control to TCP Channel Initializer.

[[tcp-channel-initializer]]
=== TCP Channel Initializer

This class is used for channel initialization / rejection and passing
arguments. +
After a new channel has been registered it calls Switch Connection
Handler’s (OF Plugin) accept method to decide if the library should keep
the newly registered channel or if the channel should be closed. If the
channel has been accepted, TCP Channel Initializer creates the whole
pipeline with needed handlers and also with ConnectionAdapter instance.
After the channel pipeline is ready, Switch Connection Handler is
notified with onConnectionReady notification. OpenFlow Plugin can now
start sending messages downstream.

[[idle-handler]]
=== Idle Handler

If there are no messages received for more than time specified, this
handler triggers idle state notification. +
The switch idle timeout is received as a parameter from
ConnectionConfiguration settings. Idle State Handler is inactive while
there are messages received within the switch idle timeout. If there are
no messages received for more than timeout specified, handler creates
SwitchIdleEvent message and sends it upstream.

[[tls-handler]]
=== TLS Handler

It encrypts and decrypts messages over TLS protocol. +
Engaging TLS Handler into pipeline is matter of configuration ( tag).
TLS communication is either unsupported or required. TLS Handler is
represented as a Netty’s SslHandler.

[[of-frame-decoder]]
=== OF Frame Decoder

Parses input stream into correct length message frames for further
processing. +
Framing is based on Openflow header length. If received message is
shorter than minimal length of OpenFlow message (8 bytes), OF Frame
Decoder waits for more data. After receiving at least 8 bytes the
decoder checks length in OpenFlow header. If there are still some bytes
missing, the decoder waits for them. Else the OF Frame Decoder sends
correct length message to next handler in the channel pipeline.

[[of-version-detector]]
=== OF Version Detector

Detects version of used OpenFlow Protocol and discards unsupported
version messages. +
If the detected version is supported, OF Version Detector creates
VersionMessageWrapper object containing the detected version and byte
message and sends this object upstream.

[[of-decoder]]
=== OF Decoder

Chooses correct deserilization factory (based on message type) and
deserializes messages into generated DTOs (Data Transfer Object). +
OF Decoder receives VersionMessageWrapper object and passes it to
DeserializationFactory which will return translated DTO.
DeserializationFactory creates MessageCodeKey object with version and
type of received message and Class of object that will be the received
message deserialized into. This object is used as key when searching for
appropriate decoder in DecoderTable. DecoderTable is basically a map
storing decoders. Found decoder translates received message into DTO. If
there was no decoder found, null is returned. After returning translated
DTO back to OF Decoder, the decoder checks if it is null or not. When
the DTO is null, the decoder logs this state and throws an Exception.
Else it passes the DTO further upstream. Finally, the OF Decoder
releases ByteBuf containing received and decoded byte message.

[[of-encoder]]
=== OF Encoder

Chooses correct serialization factory (based on type of DTO) and
serializes DTOs into byte messages. +
OF Encoder does the opposite than the OF Decoder using the same
principle. OF Encoder receives DTO, passes it for translation and if the
result is not null, it sends translated DTO downstream as a ByteBuf.
Searching for appropriate encoder is done via MessageTypeKey, based on
version and class of received DTO.

[[delegating-inbound-handler]]
=== Delegating Inbound Handler

Delegates received DTOs to Connection Adapter. +
It also reacts on channelInactive and channelUnregistered events. Upon
one of these events is triggered, DelegatingInboundHandler creates
DisconnectEvent message and sends it upstream, notifying upper layers
about switch disconnection.

[[channel-outbound-queue]]
=== Channel Outbound Queue

Message flushing handler. +
Stores outgoing messages (DTOs) and flushes them. Flush is performed
based on time expired and on the number of messages enqueued.

[[connection-adapter]]
=== Connection Adapter

Provides a facade on top of pipeline, which hides netty.io specifics.
Provides a set of methods to register for incoming messages and to send
messages to particular channel / session. +
ConnectionAdapterImpl basically implements three interfaces (unified in
one superinterface ConnectionFacade):

* ConnectionAdapter
* MessageConsumer
* OpenflowProtocolService

*ConnectionAdapter* interface has methods for setting up listeners
(message, system and connection ready listener), method to check if all
listeners are set, checking if the channel is alive and disconnect
method. Disconnect method clears responseCache and disables consuming of
new messages.

*MessageConsumer* interface holds only one method: consume(). Consume()
method is called from DelegatingInboundHandler. This method processes
received DTO’s based on their type. There are three types of received
objects:

* _System notifications_ - invoke system notifications in OpenFlow
Plugin (systemListener set). In case of DisconnectEvent message, the
Connection Adapter clears response cache and disables consume() method
processing,
* _OpenFlow asynchronous messages (from switch)_ - invoke corresponding
notifications in OpenFlow Plugin,
* _OpenFlow symmetric messages (replies to requests)_ - create
RpcResponseKey with XID and DTO’s class set. This RpcResponseKey is then
used to find corresponding future object in responseCache. Future object
is set with success flag, received message and errors (if any occurred).
In case no corresponding future was found in responseCache, Connection
Adapter logs warning and discards the message. Connection Adapter also
logs warning when an unknown DTO is received.

Openflow Protocol Library:Openflow Protocol Library's message processing[Openflow
Protocol Library:Openflow Protocol Library's message processing]

*OpenflowProtocolService* interface contains all rpc-methods for sending
messages from upper layers (OpenFlow Plugin) downstream and responding.
Request messages return Future filled with expected reply message,
otherwise the expected Future is of type Void.

*NOTE:* +
MultipartRequest message is the only exception. Basically it is request
– reply Message type, but it wouldn’t be able to process more following
MultipartReply messages if this was implemented as rpc (only one
Future). This is why MultipartReply is implemented as notification.
OpenFlow Plugin takes care of correct message processing.

[[udp-channel-pipeline-openflow-protocol-impl]]
== UDP Channel pipeline (openflow-protocol-impl)

Creates UDP channel processing pipeline based on configuration and
support. Switch Connection Provider, Channel Outbound Queue and
Connection Adapter fulfill the same role as in case of TCP connection /
channel pipeline (please see above).

[[udp-handler]]
=== UDP Handler

Represents single server that is handling incoming connections over UDP
(DTLS) protocol. +
UDP Handler creates a single instance of UDP Channel Initializer that
will initialize channels. After that it binds to configured InetAddress
and port. When a new device connects, UDP Handler registers its channel
and passes control to UDP Channel Initializer.

image:UdpChannelPipeline.png[Channel pipeline,title="Channel pipeline"]

[[udp-channel-initializer]]
=== UDP Channel Initializer

This class is used for channel initialization and passing arguments. +
After a new channel has been registered (for UDP there is always only
one channel) UDP Channel Initializer creates whole pipeline with needed
handlers.

[[dtls-handler]]
=== DTLS Handler

Haven't been implemented yet. Will take care of secure DTLS connections.

[[of-datagram-packet-handler]]
=== OF Datagram Packet Handler

Combines functionality of OF Frame Decoder and OF Version Detector.
Extracts messages from received datagram packets and checks if message
version is supported. If there is a message received from yet unknown
sender, OF Datagram Packet Handler creates Connection Adapter for this
sender and stores it under sender's address in UdpConnectionMap. This
map is also used for sending the messages and for correct Connection
Adapter lookup - to delegate messages from one channel to multiple
sessions.

[[of-datagram-packet-decoder]]
=== OF Datagram Packet Decoder

Chooses correct deserilization factory (based on message type) and
deserializes messages into generated DTOs. +
OF Decoder receives VersionMessageUdpWrapper object and passes it to
DeserializationFactory which will return translated DTO.
DeserializationFactory creates MessageCodeKey object with version and
type of received message and Class of object that will be the received
message deserialized into. This object is used as key when searching for
appropriate decoder in DecoderTable. DecoderTable is basically a map
storing decoders. Found decoder translates received message into DTO
(DataTransferObject). If there was no decoder found, null is returned.
After returning translated DTO back to OF Datagram Packet Decoder, the
decoder checks if it is null or not. When the DTO is null, the decoder
logs this state. Else it looks up appropriate Connection Adapter in
UdpConnectionMap and passes the DTO to found Connection Adapter.
Finally, the OF Decoder releases ByteBuf containing received and decoded
byte message.

[[of-datagram-packet-encoder]]
=== OF Datagram Packet Encoder

Chooses correct serialization factory (based on type of DTO) and
serializes DTOs into byte messages. +
OF Datagram Packet Encoder does the opposite than the OF Datagram Packet
Decoder using the same principle. OF Encoder receives DTO, passes it for
translation and if the result is not null, it sends translated DTO
downstream as a datagram packet. Searching for appropriate encoder is
done via MessageTypeKey, based on version and class of received DTO.
