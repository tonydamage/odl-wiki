[[plugin-to-switch-message-without-response]]
== Plugin to Switch message (without response)

Steps:

* [1] Plugin sends DTO (without response) to the library via
corresponding Connection Adapter's method
** [1.1] Connection Adapter creates channel Future object and returns
the reference to the Plugin.
** [1.2] Plugin is notified on sending success / error by this Future
object
* [2] DTO is passed to Channel pipeline for serialization
* [3] Library sends serialized DTO to switch and sets the Future object
(see [1.2])

[[messages-with-response]]
== Messages with response

Steps:

* [1] Plugin sends DTO (with expected response) to the Connection
Adapter
* [2] Library creates Future object and stores it in ResponseCache
** [2.1] The Future object is later used for assigning the reply to
corresponding request
* [3] DTO is passed to Channel pipeline for serialization
* [4] Library sends serialized DTO to switch and sets the Future object
(see [1.2])
* [5] Reply message is received from the Switch
* [6] When the reply message is deserialized, responseCache is searched
for the corresponding Future object
* [7] The Future object is set with received message (and Plugin can
continue processing)
** [7.1] If the Future object wasn't found - warning is logged
