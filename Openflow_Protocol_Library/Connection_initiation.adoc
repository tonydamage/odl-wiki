== Tcp Connection Initialization

To initiate connection to device (switch): +
[1] SwitchConnectionProvider offers initiateConnection() method which is
called by OF Plugin. +
[2] This method calls TcpConnectionInitializer.initiateConnection()
which establishes connection to the device [3] +
[4] After the connection is established, the channel is registered and
the flow continues the same way as for TcpHandler +
: - into TcpChannelInitializer which builds the whole pipeline [5] with
needed handlers and ConnectionAdapter to communicate with OF Plugin
[6] +
 Note:

* (i) In SwitchConnectionProviderImpl.createAndConfigureServer() the
workerGroup from TCPHandler is shared with the TcpConnectionInitializer
class in order to share threads' resources.
