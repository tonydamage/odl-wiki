[[of-1.0-and-of-1.3-message-differences]]
== OF 1.0 and OF 1.3 message differences

There are differences between OF 1.0 and OF 1.3 messages (for example
the ofp_match structure is completely different). These differences are
handled by using additional fields in generated DTOs. This way some
fields might be null. Splitting the Library into separate bundles
according to Openflow version supported, should fix this issue.

For example:

Packet-in message in OF 1.0 (see structure below) would have in_port
field set and table_id, cookie, match fields empty (null). The packet-in
message in OF 1.3 would be the opposite.

[[of-1.0-vendor-and-stats-message-dtos]]
== OF 1.0 Vendor and Stats message DTOs

Vendor messages are represented as ExperimenterMessage/ExperimenterInput
objects (as the messages were renamed in later Openflow versions). +
Similarly Stats messages use MultipartReplyMessage/MultipartRequestInput
objects.

[[using-supertypes-higher-types]]
== Using supertypes (higher types)

Values used for communication with switch are represented as unsigned
values. Java uses signed values - which can store only a half of
unsigned (positive) values. To ensure that correct values are
(de)serialized, the values are set into supertypes (higher types). For
example uint32 is represented as Long, uint16 as Integer and so on.

[[signed-int-to-unsigned-long-conversion-and-vice-versa]]
== Signed int to unsigned long conversion and vice versa

There are cases when we need to convert signed integer into unsigned
long. For example the ofp_port_no (special port values in OF 1.3). Yang
generates enums with .getIntValue() method. Special values (like
0xffffffff) would be represented as negative integers. For this purpose
it is needed to use BinContent class. It is located in
openflow-protocol-api project, under src/main/java/*.util package. This
class does the translation into unsigned value. BinContent also provides
method for the opposite case.

[[table-miss-flow-entry]]
== Table-miss flow entry

To set up a table-miss flow entry in switch table it is needed to create
FlowMod message with desired flow properties and an empty match. Match
is considered empty when it has only type specified (no oxm_fields are
present).
