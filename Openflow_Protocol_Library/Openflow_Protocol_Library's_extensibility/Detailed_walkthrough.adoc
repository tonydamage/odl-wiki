=== External interface & class description

*OFGeneralDeserializer:*

* *OFDeserializer*
** _deserialize(ByteBuf)_ – deserializes given ByteBuf
* *HeaderDeserializer*
** _deserializeHeaders(ByteBuf)_ - deserializes only E headers (used in
Multipart TableFeatures messages)

*DeserializerRegistryInjector*

* _injectDeserializerRegistry(DeserializerRegistry)_ – injects
deserializer registry into deserializer. Useful when custom deserializer
needs access to other deserializers.

*NOTE:* DeserializerRegistryInjector is not OFGeneralDeserializer
descendand. It is a standalone interface.

*MessageCodeKey and its descendants* +
These keys are used as for deserializer lookup in
DeserializerRegistry. +
MessageCodeKey should is used in general, while its descendants are used
in more special cases. For Example ActionDeserializerKey is used for
Action deserializer lookup and (de)registration. Vendor is provided with
special keys, which contain only the most necessary fields. These keys
usually start with "Experimenter" prefix (MatchEntryDeserializerKey is
an exception).

MessageCodeKey has these fields:

* _short version_ – Openflow wire version number
* _int value_ – value read from byte message
* ''Class clazz - class of object being creating

[[scenario-walkthrough]]
=== Scenario walkthrough

[1] The scenario starts in a custom bundle which wants to extend
library's functionality. The custom bundle creates deserializers which
implement exposed OFDeserializer / HeaderDeserializer interfaces
(wrapped under OFGeneralDeserializer unifying super interface).

[2] Created deserializers are paired with corresponding
ExperimenterKeys, which are used for deserializer lookup. +
If you don't know what key should be used with your (de)serializer
implementation, please visit
Openflow Protocol Library:Openflow Protocol Library's extensibility:Registration keys[
Registration keys] page.

[3] Paired deserializers are passed to the OF Library via
*SwitchConnectionProvider*_.registerCustomDeserializer(key, impl)_.
Library registers the deserializer.

* While registering, Library checks if the deserializer is an instance
of *DeserializerRegistryInjector* interface. If yes, the
DeserializerRegistry (which stores all deserializer references) is
injected into the deserializer.

This is particularly useful when the deserializer needs access to other
deserializers. For example IntructionsDeserializer needs access to
ActionsDeserializer in order to be able to process
OFPIT_WRITE_ACTIONS/OFPIT_APPLY_ACTIONS instructions. +

[[scenario-walkthrough-1]]
=== Scenario walkthrough

[1] Serialization extensbility principles are similar to the
deserialization principles. The scenario starts in a custom bundle. The
custom bundle creates serializers which implement exposed OFSerializer /
HeaderSerializer interfaces (wrapped under OFGeneralSerializer unifying
super interface).

[[switchconnectionprovider]]
==== SwitchConnectionProvider

SwitchConnectionProvider constructs and initializes both deserializer
and serializer registries with default (de)serializers. It also injects
the DeserializerRegistry into the DeserializationFactory, the
SerializerRegistry into the SerializationFactory. +
When call to register custom (de)serializer is made,
SwitchConnectionProvider calls register method on appropriate registry.

[[deserializerregistry-serializerregistry]]
==== DeserializerRegistry / SerializerRegistry

Both registries contain init() method to initialize default
(de)serializers. +
Registration checks if key or (de)serializer implementation are not
null. If at least one of the is null, NullPointerException is thrown.
Else the (de)serializer implementation is checked if it is
(De)SerializerRegistryInjector instance. If it is an instance of this
interface, the registry is injected into this (de)serializer
implementation.

GetSerializer(key) or GetDeserializer(key) performs registry lookup.
Because there are two separate interfaces that might be put into the
registry, the registry uses their unifying super interface.
Get(De)Serializer(key) method casts the super interface to desired type.
There is also a null check for the (de)serializer received from the
registry. If the deserializer wasn’t found, NullPointerException with
key description is thrown.
