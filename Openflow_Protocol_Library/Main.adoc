OpenFlow Protocol Library is component in OpenDaylight, that mediates
communication between OpenDaylight controller and hardware devices
supporting OpenFlow protocol. Primary goal is to provide user (or upper
layers of OpenDaylight) communication channel, that can be used for
managing network hardware devices.

[[key-objectives]]
=== Key objectives

* Simultaneous support of multiple versions of OpenFlow wire-protocol
* Extensibility to support later OpenFlow versions and OpenFlow
extensions
* Immutable transfer objects generation
* Scalable non-blocking implementation
* Pipeline processing
* Scatter buffer
* TLS support

[[common-principles]]
=== Common principles

* Serialization (message coding / decoding) logic is separated from
implementation of transfer objects.

* All transfer objects returned from this library are immutable.

* Input/Output processing is done via processing pipeline, which could
be modified in runtime based on session characteristics (e.g. support of
multiple binary protocol versions).
