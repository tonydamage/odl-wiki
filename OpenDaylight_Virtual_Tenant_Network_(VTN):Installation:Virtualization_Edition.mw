=== Launch the VTN Coordinator ===
==== Prior Preparation ====
===== Install additional applications required for VTN Coordinator =====
:* yum install perl-Digest-SHA uuid libxslt libcurl unixODBC
:* wget <nowiki>http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm</nowiki>

 Important Note:Follow this below tomcat procedure only if you downloaded Hydrogen release version.
Please use any one of the below procedure

;* Configuration via script 

Download the following file
:[[File:Tomcat setup.sh|Tomcat installation and configuration]]
	
To run the script:
	
: ./Tomcat_setup.sh
	
 Note:Run the script as a sudo user

;* Manual Configuration
:1. Install Tomcat.
:* Download the following file.
:** http://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-7/v7.0.39/bin/apache-tomcat-7.0.39.tar.gz
:* Extract under /usr/share/java.
 tar zxvf apache-tomcat-7.0.39.tar.gz -C /usr/share/java

:2. Carry out Tomcat settings.
:* Create the following symbolic link.
 ln -s /usr/local/vtn/tomcat/webapps/vtn-webapi /usr/share/java/apache-tomcat-7.0.39/webapps/vtn-webapi
:* Add the following to common.loader of /usr/share/java/apache-tomcat-7.0.39/conf/catalina.properties.
 /usr/local/vtn/tomcat/lib,/usr/local/vtn/tomcat/lib/*.jar

   curl -X GET -H 'content-type: application/json' -H 'username: admin' -H 'password: adminpass' \
   -H 'ipaddr:127.0.0.1' <nowiki>http://<VTN_COORDINATOR_IP_ADDRESS>:8080/vtn-webapi/api_version.json</nowiki>
:Response   
   {"api_version":{"version":"V1.0"}}
