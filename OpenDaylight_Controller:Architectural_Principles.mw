== Overview == 
# '''Runtime Modularity and Extensibility''': OSGI allows us to have a  modular, extensible controller that supports in service software upgrade (ISSU)
# '''Multiprotocol Southbound''': Allow for more than one protocol interface with network elements with diverse capabilities southbound from the controller.
# '''Software Abstraction Layer (SAL)''': Provides extensibility to support new southbound  protocols, while providing stable interfaces northbound.
# '''Open Extensible Northbound API''':  REST (level 3 API), OSGI framework for Java function calls (level 2 API)
# '''Fully Multitenant via Container''': Containers have been architected to be self-sufficient functional entities that contain component instances of various types that are logically grouped together to provide a specific set of services.  Essentially, you can have multiple containers running in the same controller at the same time (identified by its unique container name) and each runs in its own domain.
# '''Consistent Clustering''': Clustering that gives fine grand redundancy and scale out while insuring network consistency.
