== Overview == 

# '''Runtime Modularity and Extensibility''': Allow for a  modular, extensible controller that supports installation, removal and updates of service implementations within a running controller, also known ask in service software upgrade (ISSU)
# '''Multiprotocol Southbound''': Allow for more than one protocol interface with network elements with diverse capabilities southbound from the controller.
# '''Service Abstraction Layer (SAL)''': Where possible, allow for multiple southbound protocols to present the same northbound service interfaces.
# '''Open Extensible Northbound API''': Allow for an extensible set of application-facing APIs both across runtimes via REST (level 3 API) and within the same runtime, i.e., via function calls (level 2 API). The set of accessible functions should be the same.
# '''Support for Multitenancy/Slicing''': Allow for the network to be logically (and/or physically) split into different slices or tenants with parts of the controller, modules, explicitly dedicated to one or a subset of of these slices. This includes allowing the controller to present different views of the controller depending on which slice the caller is from.
# '''Consistent Clustering''': Clustering that gives fine-grained redundancy and scale out while insuring network consistency.
