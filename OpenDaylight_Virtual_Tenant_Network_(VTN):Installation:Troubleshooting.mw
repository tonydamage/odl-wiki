==How to install VTN Coordinator?==
* [[OpenDaylight Virtual Tenant Network (VTN):Installation:VTN Coordinator|Install coordinator from source]]

==After executing db_setup, you have encountered the error "Failed to setup database"?==
The error could be due to the below reasons
* Access Restriction Errors
  Only installed user (the user who installed VTN coordinator) can start db_setup.
  So please make sure the owner of the directory /usr/local/vtn matches with the username of the installed user.
  If not please run the below command (assuming the user name as vtn),
         chown -R vtn:vtn /usr/local/vtn
* Postgres not Present 
  1.In case of Fedora/CentOS/RHEL, please check if /usr/pgsql/<version> directory is present and also ensure the commands 
    initdb, createdb,pg_ctl,psql are working. If, not please re-install postgres packages

  2.In case of Ubuntu, check if /usr/lib/postgres/<version> directory is present and check for 
    the commands as in the previous step.

* Not enough space to create tables
 Please check df -k and ensure enough free space is available.
      
* If the above steps do not solve the problem, please refer to the log file for the exact problem
      /usr/local/vtn/var/dbm/unc_setup_db.log for the exact error.

==How to debug a startup failure? ==
The following activities take place in order during startup
* Database server is started after setting virtual memory to required value
     Any database startup errors will be reflected in any of the below logs
    /usr/local/vtn/var/dbm/unc_db_script.log.
    /usr/local/vtn/var/db/pg_log/postgresql-*.log (the pattern will have the date)

* uncd daemon is kicked off, The daemon in turn kicks off the rest of the daemons.
     Any  uncd startup failures will be reflected in /usr/local/vtn/var/uncd/uncd_start.err.

==If you encounter an erroneous situation where the REST API is always failing.==
    Please ensure the firewall settings for port:8080 and enable the same.

== How to debug a REST API returning a failure message? ==
   Please check the /usr/share/java/apache-tomcat-7.0.39/logs/core/core.log for failure details.

== REST API for VTN configuration fails, how to debug? ==
The default log level for all daemons is "INFO", to debug the situation TRACE or DEBUG logs may be needed.
To increase the log level for individual daemons, please use the commands suggested below

   /usr/local/vtn/bin/lgcnw_control loglevel trace -- upll daemon log 
   /usr/local/vtn/bin/phynw_control loglevel trace -- uppl daemon log 
   /usr/local/vtn/bin/unc_control loglevel trace -- uncd daemon log 
   /usr/local/vtn/bin/drvodc_control loglevel trace -- Driver daemon log 

After setting the log levels, the operation can be repeated and the log files can be referred for debugging.
