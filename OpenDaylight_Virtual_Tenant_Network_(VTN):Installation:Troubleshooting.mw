==How to debug a startup failure? ==
The following activities take place in order during startup
* Database server is started after setting virtual memory to required value
     Any database startup errors will be reflected in any of the below logs
    /usr/local/vtn/var/dbm/unc_db_script.log.
    /usr/local/vtn/var/db/pg_log/postgresql-*.log (the pattern will have the date)

* uncd daemon is kicked off, The daemon in turn kicks off the rest of the daemons.
     Any  uncd startup failures will be reflected in /usr/local/vtn/var/uncd/uncd_start.err.
     please refer to the file for any errors.

==After setting up the apache tomcat server, what are the aspects that should be checked.==
     Please check if catalina is running.

==If you encounter an erroneous situation where the REST API is always failing.==
    Please ensure the firewall settings for port:8080 and enable the same.

== How to debug a REST API returning a failure message? ==
   Please check the /usr/share/java/apache-tomcat-7.0.39/logs/core/core.log for failure details.

== Tip to debug individual applications for configuration ==
The default log level for all daemons is "INFO", to debug the situation TRACE or DEBUG logs may be needed.
To increase the log level for individual daemons, please use the commands suggested below

   /usr//local/vtn/bin/lgcnw_control loglevel trace -- upll daemon log 
   /usr//local/vtn/bin/phynw_control loglevel trace -- uppl daemon log 
   /usr//local/vtn/bin/unc_control loglevel trace -- uncd daemon log 
   /usr//local/vtn/bin/drvodc_control loglevel trace -- Driver daemon log 

After setting the log levels, the operation can be repeated and the log files can be refreed for debugging.
