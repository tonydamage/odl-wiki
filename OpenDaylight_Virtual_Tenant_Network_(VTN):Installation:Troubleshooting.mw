==How to install VTN Coordinator?==
* [[OpenDaylight Virtual Tenant Network (VTN):Installation:VTN Coordinator|Install coordinator from source]]

==After executing db_setup, you have encountered the error "Failed to setup database"?==
The error could be due to the below reasons
* Access Restriction
  The user who owns /usr/local/vtn/ directory and installs VTN coordinator, can only start db_setup.
  Example : 
  The directory should appear as below (assuming the user as "vtn"):
  # ls -l /usr/local/
    drwxr-xr-x. 12 vtn  vtn  4096 Mar 14 21:53 vtn
  If the user doesnot own /usr/local/vtn/ then, please run the below command (assuming the username as vtn),
                 chown -R vtn:vtn /usr/local/vtn
* Postgres not Present 
  1.In case of Fedora/CentOS/RHEL, please check if /usr/pgsql/<version> directory is present and also ensure the commands 
    initdb, createdb,pg_ctl,psql are working. If, not please re-install postgres packages

  2.In case of Ubuntu, check if /usr/lib/postgres/<version> directory is present and check for 
    the commands as in the previous step.

* Not enough space to create tables
 Please check df -k and ensure enough free space is available.
      
* If the above steps do not solve the problem, please refer to the log file for the exact problem
      /usr/local/vtn/var/dbm/unc_setup_db.log for the exact error.

==What are the things to check after vtn_start?==
* list of coordinator processes
* Run the below command ensure the Coordinator daemons are running.
     Command:   /usr/local/vtn/bin/unc_dmctl status
                Name         Type      IPC Channel      PID
        -------------------- ------------ ---------------- --------
             drvodcd       DRIVER          drvodcd    15972
              lgcnwd      LOGICAL           lgcnwd    16010
              phynwd     PHYSICAL           phynwd    15996

    
* Issue the curl command to fetch version and ensure the process is able to respond.

==How to debug a startup failure? ==
The following activities take place in order during startup
* Database server is started after setting virtual memory to required value
     Any database startup errors will be reflected in any of the below logs
    /usr/local/vtn/var/dbm/unc_db_script.log.
    /usr/local/vtn/var/db/pg_log/postgresql-*.log (the pattern will have the date)

* uncd daemon is kicked off, The daemon in turn kicks off the rest of the daemons.
     Any  uncd startup failures will be reflected in /usr/local/vtn/var/uncd/uncd_start.err.
     please refer to the file for any errors.

==After setting up the apache tomcat server, what are the aspects that should be checked.==
     Please check if catalina is running.

     The command ps -ef | grep catalina | grep -v grep should list a catalina process

==If you encounter an erroneous situation where the REST API is always failing.==
    Please ensure the firewall settings for port:8080(Hydrogen release) or port:8083(Post Hydrogen release) and enable the same.

== How to debug a REST API returning a failure message? ==

*Use following command to find out the vtn process
   $ ps aux |grep vtn
   /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java -Xmx512M -Djava.endorsed.dirs=/usr/local/vtn/tomcat/endorsed -Djava.io.tmpdir=/usr/local/vtn/var/tomcat/tmp -Dcatalina.base=/usr/local/vtn/to
   mcat -Dcatalina.home=/usr/local/vtn/tomcat -Dvtn.logdir=/usr/local/vtn/var/tomcat/log -Dvtn.workdir=/usr/local/vtn/var/tomcat/work -Dvtn.logger.jar=log4j-1.2.17.jar -Dvtn.java.libdir=/usr/loc  
   al/vtn/lib/java/jar -Dvtn.port=8083 -Dvtn.ipc.watch=uncd -classpath /usr/local/vtn/tomcat/bin/bootstrap.jar:/usr/local/vtn/tomcat/bin/tomcat-juli.jar org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap start
*-Dvtn.logdir is exactly what we want
   -Dvtn.logdir=/usr/local/vtn/var/tomcat/log
* Please check the core.log in logdir showing above for failure details.

== REST API for VTN configuration fails, how to debug? ==
The default log level for all daemons is "INFO", to debug the situation TRACE or DEBUG logs may be needed.
To increase the log level for individual daemons, please use the commands suggested below

   /usr/local/vtn/bin/lgcnw_control loglevel trace -- upll daemon log 
   /usr/local/vtn/bin/phynw_control loglevel trace -- uppl daemon log 
   /usr/local/vtn/bin/unc_control loglevel trace -- uncd daemon log 
   /usr/local/vtn/bin/drvodc_control loglevel trace -- Driver daemon log 

After setting the log levels, the operation can be repeated and the log files can be referred for debugging.

== Problems while Installing PostgreSQL due to openssl  ==

Errors may occur when trying to install postgreSQL rpms.
Recently PostgreSQL has upgraded all their binaries to use the latest openssl versions with fix for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed heartbleed bug]. Please upgrade the openssl package to the latest version and re-install. 

For RHEL 6.1/6.4 : If you have subscription, Please use the same and update the rpms. The details are available in this link:[https://access.redhat.com/site/solutions/781793 ACCESS-REDHAT].

If you do not have subscription, Please use the Cent OS 6 yum respository and update the openssl package.
[http://mirrors.kernel.org/centos/6/os/x86_64/Packages CentOS6]

   rpm -Uvh http://mirrors.kernel.org/centos/6/os/x86_64/Packages/openssl-1.0.1e-15.el6.x86_64.rpm
   rpm -ivh http://mirrors.kernel.org/centos/6/os/x86_64/Packages/openssl-devel-1.0.1e-15.el6.x86_64.rpm 

For other linux platforms, Please do yum update, the public respositroes will have the latest openssl, please install the same.
