This page is a collection of topics of that are of interest to developers for Open DOVE and topics coming from the development of Open DOVE that might be of interest to OpenDaylight developers.

== General Topics ==

* [[oDMC: Using MOXy as the JAXB provider]]
* [[Mapping from Neutron to OpenDove]]

== Code Structure ==

* [[oDMC Bundle Structure]]
* [[oDCS Code Structure]]
* [[oDGW Code Structure]]
* [[OVS-Agent Code Structure]]

== Building Dove Components ==

First pull the OpenDove code with

<pre>
git clone ssh://<username>@git.opendaylight.org:29418/opendove.git
</pre>

===Building the oDMC===

From the opendove directory, simply execute:

<pre>
mvn clean install
</pre>

===Building the oDCS===
Prerequisites: Any RedHAT type system (Ubuntu or Fedora works just fine though you may need to download some packages depending on your environment, e.g., python-dev, libjansson-dev, libevent-dev, openssl).

READ the PYTHON_README file and download the necessary files.

The os_distributor_script file must be made executable (chmod +x)

Use "make" to build - The executable files and .pyc scripts end up in the "build" directory.
Use "make clean" to delete the compiled files.
