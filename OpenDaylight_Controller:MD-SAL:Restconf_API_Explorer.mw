MD-SAL 's RESTful interfaces are designed based on RESTCONF protocol (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-bierman-netconf-restconf/). These interfaces are generated dyamically at runtime based on YANG models that defines its data. Since interface generation is dynamic, there are no statically compiled Java classes that can be annotated to create pretty documentation. The lack of documentation is one of the common complains from users of MD-SAL.

RESTCONF API Explorer should address that complain. It is deployed as an OSGI bundle that generates and renders the documentation at runtime. The generated documentation is based on Swagger specification (https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/1.2.md) and is rendered on Swagger UI which is embedded in this bundle.

=Usage=

API explorer is accesible at
 http://localhost:8080/apidoc/explorer

Replace <code>localhost</code> with IP of your controller, ofcourse! You should see UI like the one in Fig 1 below.

=Dynamic doc generation=
At runtime, this component queries MD-SAL to get access to Schema Service. Schema Service contains Schema Context that maintains a repository of all yang modules available in the system. Each module is then converted into swagger spec compliant json document. Restconf API Explorer exposes RESTful interfaces of its own to serve these JSON Document. The web ui uses these RESTful interfaces to render ui.
