MD-SAL 's RESTful interfaces are designed based on RESTCONF protocol (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-bierman-netconf-restconf/). These interfaces are generated dyamically at runtime based on YANG models that defines its data. Since interface generation is dynamic, there are no statically compiled Java classes that can be annotated to create pretty documentation. The lack of documentation is one of the common complains from users of MD-SAL.

RESTCONF API Explorer should address that complain. It is deployed as an OSGI bundle that generates and renders the documentation at runtime. The generated documentation is based on Swagger specification (https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/1.2.md) and is rendered on Swagger UI which is embedded in this bundle.

=Usage=

==Getting resource listing==
API explorer is accesible at
 http://localhost:8080/apidoc/explorer

[[File:Api-explorer.png|700px| thumb| Fig 1]]

Replace <code>localhost</code> with IP of your controller, ofcourse! You should see UI like the one in Fig 1.

''Resource List URL'' textbox is pre-populated with the URL. Press ''explore'' button to get the listing. 

''Note: This may take up to a min to load in your browser. Its just that server returns a lot of JSON documents for the browser to load. We'll add optimizations to make the loading time faster.''

Once browser loads up the listing, any resource collection can be reviewed by expanding it (by clicking on it)

==Working with a resource==

Expanding a resource collection would list all supported resources (Fig 2). Any resource can further be examined by clicking on it (Fig 3).

''Descriptions and Model definitions'' are generated from <code>yang</code> files.

HTML form is generated by swagger and is based on [https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/1.2.md#52-api-declaration API Declaration Specification]. Use this to execute the API and see request/response on live server.

=Dynamic doc generation=
At runtime, this component queries MD-SAL to get access to Schema Service. Schema Service contains Schema Context that maintains a repository of all yang modules available in the system. Each module is then converted into swagger spec compliant json document. Restconf API Explorer exposes RESTful interfaces of its own to serve these JSON Document. The web ui uses these RESTful interfaces to render ui.
