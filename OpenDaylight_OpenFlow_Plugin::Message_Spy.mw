= Why we need internal message statistics =
We need message counts in OFPlugin for testing and diagnosting purposes. 
Expected result contains amount of messages of particular type per unit of time.

= Implemented strategy =
There are 2 tasks - collect counts and expose counts. By collecting the counts are grouped by message type and checkpoint. 
Results are exposed via log, osgi and jmx.

== Collect ==
There are following checkpoints where messages are counted while passing (defined as enum):
   /**
     * statistic groups overall in OFPlugin
     */
    enum STATISTIC_GROUP {
        /** message from switch, enqueued for processing */
        FROM_SWITCH_ENQUEUED,
        /** message from switch translated successfully - source */
        FROM_SWITCH_TRANSLATE_IN_SUCCESS,
        /** message from switch translated successfully - target */
        FROM_SWITCH_TRANSLATE_OUT_SUCCESS,
        /** message from switch where translation failed - source */
        FROM_SWITCH_TRANSLATE_SRC_FAILURE,
        /** message from switch finally published into MD-SAL */
        FROM_SWITCH_PUBLISHED_SUCCESS,
        /** message from switch - publishing into MD-SAL failed */
        FROM_SWITCH_PUBLISHED_FAILURE,
        
        /** message from MD-SAL to switch via RPC enqueued */
        TO_SWITCH_ENQUEUED_SUCCESS,
        /** message from MD-SAL to switch via RPC NOT enqueued */
        TO_SWITCH_ENQUEUED_FAILED,
        /** message from MD-SAL to switch - sent to OFJava successfully */
        TO_SWITCH_SUBMITTED_SUCCESS,
        /** message from MD-SAL to switch - sent to OFJava but failed*/
        TO_SWITCH_SUBMITTED_FAILURE
    }

When a message passes any of those checkpoints then counter assigned to corresponding checkpoint and message class is increased by 1.

== Expose results ==
In order to access statistics there are 3 ways:
* osgi command (on demand) - this is considered deprecated
*: <tt>osgi> dumpMsgCount</tt>
* controller console (stats are dumped here each 10 seconds)
*: required logback settings : <tt><logger name="org.opendaylight.openflowplugin.openflow.md.queue.MessageSpyCounterImpl" level="DEBUG"\/></tt>
* JMX (via jconsole)
*: TBD
