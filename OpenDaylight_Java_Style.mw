= Introduction =

The OpenDaylight Java Style Guide is not yet defined.
There is currently discussion on the discuss mailing list.

= Requirements =

The OpenDaylight Java Style Guide will enable developers to output code that is consistent in style across project. This enhances readability and also allows developers to contribute in each project without having to change their code style.

* Code Style should be automatically enforced by the IDE and as a compile-time check
* Code Repositories should be gated such that only commits that pass the style-check are merged

= Proposal = 

The current proposal is hosted on [https://github.com/dave-tucker/opendaylight-java-guide/ GitHub]

* Elements that can be enforced with the [https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-checkstyle-plugin/ Maven Checkstyle Plugin] will be checked at compile time
* Elements that cannot be enforce in Checkstyle will be enforced by the IDE
** Code Style settings will be maintained for Eclipse and re-used in IntelliJ via the [http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6546 Eclipse Code Formatter Plugin]
* Other elements, such as best practices should be manually vetted by project committers

= Rollout =

Style Checks will be introduced incrementally to avoid disruption

= CI Integration =

It is recommended to use the [https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Checkstyle+Plugin Jenkins Checkstyle Plugin]

If it is decided to integrated [http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/ FindBugs] then it is also recommended to use the accompanying [https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/FindBugs+Plugin Jenkins Plugin]
