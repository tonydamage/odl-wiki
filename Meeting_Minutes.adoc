process flows are being discussed and developments are being made.
Initial pass will be to implement monitoring using OF and OVSDB

* Policy Management - Northbound interface (Alessandro):
** Work continues on the rewrite in C++
*** move to stateless handlers, add method hint to IDs to support this,
make it possible to retrieve the the id for an Outbound Request, and to
hash upon it if one still needs to keep state for outbound requests
*** add local and remote IDs. Local IDs are present on outbound requests
and inbound responses. Remote IDs are present in inbound requests and
outbound responses.
*** expose hash-able local IDs and have a consistent hashing for
outbound IDs (method + integer) and inbound IDs (rapidjson::Value)
*** started looking into some issues with different implementations of
getaddrinfo from different libc libraries and versions thereof
* Managed Object Database (Rob):
** MODB in C++ largely done
*** speculative work on some opflex protocol message implementation,
hopefully this will be useful when the communications library is working
*** Awaiting communications library and model generation.
* Policy Enforcer (Amit):
** Opflex agent enforcer
*** finished implementation and unit-tests. Not integrated yet with
libopflex because model definition is not available (Unit-tests use a
very simple, mock MODB).
** Started reading through OVS code to determine the APIs needed from
libopenvswitch
*** the first version of the APIs are going to be similar to CLI (string
input/output); lower level functions will come in later
** Design review of agent
*** no need to communicate with OVSDB
*** enforcer to be simplified and merged with OVS renderer
* OVS API (Scott)
** Built first patch with versioning
*** Compiles, but some tests fail - working through them now
*** Builds shared libraries, by default
*** Adds version number for shared libraries
*** Option to build statically as before

* Policy Management - Northbound interface (Alessandro):
** fix silly crash
** add more debugging logs
** add connection callback for the user to get the ball rolling
** more compact and fluent Accept method for outbound messages
** fix 3 small issues in engine code
** file a bunch of tickets
** use AF_UNSPEC as address family for outbound connections
** evaluate more work to be done for dual-stack machines
** a bunch of fixes for message handling
** fix a bunch of memory leaks
** fix a few races in test code
* Managed Object Database (Rob):
** No update
* Policy Enforcer (Amit):
** Opflex agent enforcer
*** Read through OVS code to determine details of the functions and
data-structures needed by the agent (flow-mods, packet-in/port
notifications, etc)
*** Had several meetings to nail down the interface that will be
provided by the openvswitch library that Scott is working on. It appears
that all the functions and structures needed by the agent are already
available in current headers and the static library; so the plan is
continue to develop the agent against those till the proper library
(shared-object) is available.
*** Ran into compilation issues when including OVS headers in C++
program; had to refactor some OVS headers and make other minor
modifications. These changes will be pushed to Scott's fork of OVS tree
*** Worked on the flow entry diff-ing logic as part of responding to
MODB updates. Testing it.
* OVS API (Scott)
** Shared object build successful
*** except when built --with-dpdk (looking into it now)
*** all tests pass
*** fully backwards compatible to static with --disable-shared

** enable dual-stack connect (buy no happy-eyeballs since this is
machine-2-machine)
** fixlet: also set TCP keepalive and no-delay on passive connections
** heart-beat fixes
** log JSON parsing errors
** replace plain C intrusive linked lists with boost::intrusive::list
** introduce a send_handler for std::deque
** trickle down some handles into Peer's relevant subclasses
** throw away hand-written autogen.sh and replace it with a wrapper to
"autoreconf -fis"
** allow silent rules via "make V=0"
** remove any use of C-style offsetof in callbacks
** fix some compilation issues for old compilers
** polish message handling and fix a bunch of bugs
** better non-repeating logging for comms tests, coalescing consecutive
logs that are repeated
** allow to expect a timeout in comms tests
** more detailed logging throughout comms
** introduce refcount for lifetime management of peers (that can't be
deleted while callbacks are still pending on them)
** added a test for keep alive hearth-beat
* Managed Object Database (Rob):
** Set up ODL opflex repository and build system, and migrated all the
code into it (which was harder than it sounds)
** Got the code generator working with the modb, many tweaks and fixes
** Created beginning of OpFlex agent implementation, incuding project
structure, logging, build, and stubs for endpoint manager
* Policy Enforcer (Amit):
** Continued working on diff-ing flows and generating flow mods for OVS
agent. Have coded up the flow instructions for all the flow tables (for
the policy enforcer table, assuming simple accept/drop rule). Need to
work on group-table.
** Wrote unit-tests for flow mods; using string representation of the
flow entries (as given by OVS) to verify.
* OVS API (Scott)
** Submitted shared library and versioning patch to dev@openvswitch.org
*** All tests and builds pass
*** fully backwards compatible with previous static build
