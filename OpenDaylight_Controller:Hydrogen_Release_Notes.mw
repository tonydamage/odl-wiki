===Major Features===
Hydrogen release marks the first release of the Opendaylight Controller. The following features have been delivered:
* AD-SAL
* MD-SAL
* Config


====For Execution====

YANG tools are kept completely portable and require only a Java-7 compliant JVM to run. The Maven plugin requires Maven version 3.0.4 or later.

====For Development====

YANG tools is developed as a normal Java project, but it makes heavy use of [https://www.eclipse.org/xtend/ Xtend] language. While development is possible with bare tools, Eclipse with Xtend plugin is recommended.

===Known Issues and Limitations===

* During the development of Hydrogen release a number of issues have been identified in the Java Binding Specification:
** Using the same name for groupings and containers in the same context results in invalid code (issues #138, #157, #295)
** The specification contains a static get() method, conflicting with JMX implementation
** Binding's handling of unsigned types could be improved with Guava's Unsigned types
** The translation of choice/case statements requires users to use instanceof and explicit typecasts, leading to run-time errors due to missed spots in refactoring
** The exact mapping of YANG lists to Set/Map/List is not completely satisfactory

The implementation has been tested extensively with its downstream projects (openflowjava, bgpcep) and works reasonably well for complex models. There are a few known bugs which will be addressed in the next bugfix release.

===Target Environment===

====For Execution====

* OS, JRE, Is there anything else we rely on? Python? Perl? Scala? Here's a [https://www.ohloh.net/p/opendaylight/analyses/latest/languages_summary list of languages used].

====For Development====

* OS, JDK, Maven, What else?

===Known Issues and Limitations===

* Particular known bugs?
* Testing methodology. How extensive was it? What should be expected to work? What hasn't been tested as much?
* Restconf supports <tt>application/yang.data+xml</tt> and <tt>application/yang.data+json</tt> media types for <tt>/operatons</tt> resource. Both will be removed in next release.
* Clustering service not available when using MD-SAL based NSF bundles like Forwarding Rules Manager.
