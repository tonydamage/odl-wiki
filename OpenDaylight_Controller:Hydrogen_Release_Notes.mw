===Known Issues and Limitations===

* During the development of Hydrogen release a number of issues have been identified in the Java Binding Specification:
** Using the same name for groupings and containers in the same context results in invalid code (issues [https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=138 #138], [https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=157 #157], [https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=295 #295])
** The specification contains a static get() method, conflicting with JMX implementation
** Binding's handling of unsigned types could be improved with Guava's Unsigned types
** The translation of choice/case statements requires users to use instanceof and explicit typecasts, leading to run-time errors due to missed spots in refactoring
** The exact mapping of YANG lists to Set/Map/List is not completely satisfactory

The implementation has been tested extensively with its downstream projects (openflowjava, bgpcep) and works reasonably well for complex models. There are a few known bugs which will be addressed in the next bugfix release.


===Target Environment===

====For Execution====

YANG tools are kept completely portable and require only a Java-7 compliant JVM to run. The Maven plugin requires Maven version 3.0.4 or later.

'''Note: If using Oracle JDK version 1.7.0_45 or later required.'''

====For Development====

YANG tools is developed as a normal Java project, but it makes heavy use of [https://www.eclipse.org/xtend/ Xtend] language. While development is possible with bare tools, Eclipse with Xtend plugin is recommended.

'''Note: If using Oracle JDK version 1.7.0_45 or later required.'''
