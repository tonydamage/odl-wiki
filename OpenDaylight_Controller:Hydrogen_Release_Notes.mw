===Major Features===
Hydrogen release marks the first release of the Opendaylight Controller. The following features have been delivered:

==== AD-SAL ====
* Allows the Controller to support multiple protocols on the Southbound and providing consistent services for modules and Apps (where the business logic is embedded).

==== AD-SAL Openflow 1.0 Southbound Plugin ====

==== Clustering Services ====

==== AD-SAL Network Service Functions ====

==== Openflow 1.0 Controller ====

* Openflow 1.0 Controller using AD-SAL, Clustering services, AD-SAL Network Service Functions

==== Config Subsystem & Netconf Server ====

* Configuration system capable of two phase commit with APIs and SPIs exposed via JMX config beans
* Runtime statistics and other data exposed via JMX runtime beans
* YANG code generator to generate JMX, configuration interfaces and skeletons of Modules and ModuleFactories
* netconf server (plain TCP and ssh) is used as config-subsystem endpoint, wraps JMX config and runtime beans into model driven XML representation
* netconf client with advanced capabilities like reconnection strategies and capability testing
* configuration pusher and persister that delivers initial or current configuration, automatic persisting of changes after netconf commit
* low level Java APIs wrapped with yang models and configuration factories, like executor framework, netty threadgroups, logback
* shutdown management via netconf RPC

==== MD-SAL ====

==== MD-SAL Network Service Functions ====

==== MD-SAL Netconf Southbound Plugin ====

==== RESTConf ====

===Known Issues and Limitations===

* During the development of Hydrogen release a number of issues have been identified in the Java Binding Specification:
** Using the same name for groupings and containers in the same context results in invalid code (issues [https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=138 #138], [https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=157 #157], [https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=295 #295])
** The specification contains a static get() method, conflicting with JMX implementation
** Binding's handling of unsigned types could be improved with Guava's Unsigned types
** The translation of choice/case statements requires users to use instanceof and explicit typecasts, leading to run-time errors due to missed spots in refactoring
** The exact mapping of YANG lists to Set/Map/List is not completely satisfactory

The implementation has been tested extensively with its downstream projects (openflowjava, bgpcep) and works reasonably well for complex models. There are a few known bugs which will be addressed in the next bugfix release.


===Target Environment===

====For Execution====

Opendaylight Controller are kept completely portable and require only a Java-7 compliant JVM to run.

'''Note: If using Oracle JDK version 1.7.0_45 or later required.'''

====For Development====

Opendaylight Controller is developed as a normal Java project, but it makes heavy use of [https://www.eclipse.org/xtend/ Xtend] language. While development is possible with bare tools, Eclipse with Xtend plugin is recommended.

'''Note: If using Oracle JDK version 1.7.0_45 or later required.'''
