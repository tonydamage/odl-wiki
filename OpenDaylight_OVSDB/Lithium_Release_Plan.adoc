[[expected-incompatibilities-with-other-projects]]
== Expected Incompatibilities with Other Projects

OVSDB is considered incompatible with applications that program the flow
tables on vSwitches. This includes:

`   GBP` +
`   OpenDOVE` +
`   VTN`

These projects have not held discussions as to how to become compatible
because they each provide their own solution to the same problem.

[[compatibility-with-previous-releases]]
== Compatibility with Previous Releases

[[removed-apis-andor-functionality]]
=== Removed APIs and/or Functionality

The BridgeDomain APIs are removed since they were deprecated in Helium.
The APIs were not used.

[[deprecated-apis-andor-functionality]]
=== Deprecated APIs and/or Functionality

The OVSDB northbound API might be deprecated depending on the outcome of
the AD-SAL deprecation. The APIs currently use some AD-SAl dependencies.

[[changed-apis-andor-functionality]]
=== Changed APIs and/or Functionality

[[themes-and-priorities]]
== Themes and Priorities

* Increasing unit and integration test coverage to improve code quality
* Deprecate AD-SAL dependencies
* Provide an MD-SAL interface to OVSDB for crud operations

* *Requested Deliverable Name:* OVSDB interface
* *Needed Milestone:*
* *Requested Deliverable Description:* We only require the ability to
query and instantiate non-OpenFlow information such as ports, bridges,

interface and not an md-sal interface due to time constraints.

[[test-tools-requirements]]
== Test Tools Requirements

This project plans on using System Test (ST) inside OpenDaylight cloud.
In particular, the integration piece of OVSDB's net-virt will require an
Openstack Installation that uses ODL as the Neutron ML2. It is the goal
to integrate with both Icehouse and Juno.

Update: Flaviof talked with Than and is currently convinced that the
infra provided by jjb and sandbox is all that will be needed in terms of
infrastructure to have automated tests on OVSDB functionality in
Lithium. The plan will utilize VMs of the label 'dynamic_devstack'.
