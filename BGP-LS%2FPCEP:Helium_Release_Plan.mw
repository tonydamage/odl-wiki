== Introduction  ==

During the Helium code sprint we will focus on delivering two major features:
* PCEP support for Segment Routing
* BGP support for route dissemination and passive connections

Secondary goals are keeping current with drafts as they evolve, bug fixes and performance/scale improvements.

| align="left" | API design of BGP speaker
| align="left" | [https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=729 Bug729]<br>
| align="left" | Speaker capability requires us to rework AdjRIBsIn class into a per-peer structure and MD-SAL writer. We will also need interfaces for export engine.
|- align="right"
| align="left" | BGP Update message serializer<br> 
| align="left" | Done
| align="left" | For the purpose of having a full BGP speaker, having a serializer for all parts of Update message is a must.
This task also includes getting rid of using raw byte array in other parts of BGP serialization, that will also improve clearness of the code and performance.

| align="left" | Done
| align="left" | Similar to the LocRib model, we need a per-peer view of information which has been ingested (AdjRibIn) and which is to be advertized (AdjRibOut)
|- align="right"
| align="left" | Support for Segment Routing 
| align="left" | Done
| align="left" | For Helium, we are doing PCEP only. This includes extending the models to support SR paths and the related parsers/serializers.
|- align="right"
| align="left" | Support for BGP statistics 
| align="left" | [https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=989 Bug989]
| align="left" | Simple per-connection/per-rib statistics, which can be quickly reviewed. Number of PDUs received/sent, time of last PDU send/received, negotiated session capabilities.

| align="left" | [https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1116 Bug1116]
| align="left" | BGP stack needs to be able to disseminate routes using a simple export policy.
|- align="right"
| align="left" | Update PCEP drafts
| align="left" | [https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=683 Bug683]
| align="left" | PCEP drafts implemented in Hydrogen release are outdated and need to be adjusted to newer draft versions.

| align="left" | [https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=338 Done]
| align="left" | The speaker role requires us to be able to establish both active and passive sessions. The IO subsystem to handle that will be finished by API freeze.

== Compatibility with Previous Releases  ==

This release is expected to break both binary and source-code level compatibility. All Java code plugins will need to be updated. Some RESTCONF clients may need updating. The precise amount of breakage will be established by API freeze.
