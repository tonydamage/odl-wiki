== Switch to Plugin message (without response) ==
Steps:
* [1] switch sends message to the library
* [2] library deserializes the message into DTO and delegates the DTO to Connection Adapter
* [3] Connection Adapter call the corresponding notification in Plugin

== Plugin to Switch message (without response) ==
Steps:
* [1] Plugin sends DTO (without response) to the library via corresponding Connection Adapter's method
** [1.1] Connection Adapter creates channel Future object and returns the reference to the Plugin.
** [1.2] Plugin is notified on sending success / error by this Future object
* [2] DTO is passed to Channel pipeline for serialization
* [3] Library sends serialized DTO to switch and sets the Future object (see [1.2])

== Messages with response ==
Steps:
* [1] Plugin sends DTO (with expected response) to the Connection Adapter
* [2] Library creates Future object and stores it in ResponseCache
** [2.1] The Future object is later used for assigning the reply to corresponding request
* [3] DTO is passed to Channel pipeline for serialization
* [4] Library sends serialized DTO to switch and sets the Future object (see [1.2])
* [5] Reply message is received from the Switch
* [6] When the reply message is deserialized, responseCache is searched for the corresponding Future object
* [7] The Future object is set with received message (and Plugin can continue processing)
** [7.1] If the Future object wasn't found - warning is logged
