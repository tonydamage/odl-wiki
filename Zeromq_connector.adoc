[[rpc-requester]]
=== Rpc Requester

1.  Broker asks 0mq router to invoke rpc on remote vm
2.  0mq router looks up routing table to find location of service
3.  If a remote location is NOT found, send exception (or RpcResult)
back to broker
4.  If remote location is found, create a callable task and give it to
the executor pool.
1.  The callable tasks needs to establish a connection with the remote
location and send the rpc request. The socket connection must be closed
in this thread.
1.  Optimization - Maintain a socket connection pool, 1 connection per
host. The trick with this optimization is thread-safety. 0mq sockets are
not thread-safe. Sockets should only be used and closed in the thread
that created it. Check how to connect one client (REQ) socket to
multiple servers (REP) sockets. Or use ROUTER sockets instead.
2.  The callable task will block the thread and wait for the response to
come back.
1.  Optimization - Invoke RPC in a non-blocking way.
3.  The callable task will deserialize the response and create a
RpcResult object
4.  The callable task will handle zmq errors and create a RpcResult
object
5.  The callable task will return a Future.
6.  Handle thread-kill situations and create a RpcResult object
5.  Return a Future back to broker

[[reconnect-and-retries]]
==== Reconnect and Retries

* In case of network failure, the "client" component will try to
reconnect. During the reconnect, it will mark the 0mq router as
"unavailable".
* In the case when server dies, the "client" component will retry the
message for a configured number of times after which it will mark the
server as "unreachable".

[[provider]]
=== Provider

1.  0mq router receives a rpc request
2.  0mq router deserializes the request. In case of exception, create a
message with error and reply back.
3.  0mq router creates a RpcRequest and asks the broker to execute. In
case of exception, create a message with error and reply back.
1.  Optimization - call the broker non-blockingly
4.  0mq router serializes the response.

_This flow is deprecated. We will be externalizing the routing table
state in external store (eg: Infinispan)_

TBD: Rpc unregistration. Add to 0mq service shutdown.
