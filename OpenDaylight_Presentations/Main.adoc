[[introduction]]
== Introduction

This page is intended for folks who are presenting OpenDaylight to
various groups to post who they are, when they have (or will present)
and the slides they use to facilitate slide sharing :)

[[basic-collateral]]
== Basic Collateral

The OpenDaylight Foundation maintains a basic
http://www.opendaylight.org/resources/collateral[collateral deck], which
they keep up to date. Its a good place to start, and you should also
pull the membership slide from it as they keep it up to date.
