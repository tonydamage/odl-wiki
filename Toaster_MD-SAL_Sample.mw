This page describes how to use the Toaster MD-SAL example.

:We provided a simple complete example of a model, a service provider (toaster) and a service consumer in the toaster sample. It provides the model of a programmable toaster, a sample consumer application that uses MD-SAL APIs, a sample southbound plugin (a service provider) that implements toaster, and a unit test suite.

:The toaster example is in ''controller.git'' under ''opendaylight/md-sal/samples''.

== Getting Started ==

The toaster has 4 bundles.

*sample-toaster
:*This bundle defines the core yang model.
*sample-toaster-consumer
*sample-toaster-it
*sample-toaster-provider
