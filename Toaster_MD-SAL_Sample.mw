''Place questions here that we can try and get answered''
# Were the toaster-provider, toaster-provider-impl, toaster-consumer, toaster-consumer-impl yang models created post Hydrogen release when toaster initialization was moved to config subsystem?
# It will be good to show the relation between how various java classes get generated based on Yang elements. e.g. if RPCs are present it created <ModuleName>Service java class, if Notifications are present it creates <ModuleName>Listener etc
