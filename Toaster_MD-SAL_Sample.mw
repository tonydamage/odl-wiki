__TOC__

=Overview =

The Sample Toaster Tutorial has three separate sections:

* 1. Basic Toaster Modeling -> provides RESTCONF CRUD for our Toaster model
* 2. Toaster RPC Service -> provides RESTCONF RPC for operations ( make_toast )
* 3. Controller based client code -> whatever business logic you might want ... like perhaps a calorie counter which gets notified of all the toast being made ...

= Documentation Contributors =
This section can be used to track people actively contribute documentation on the Toaster example.

''Add your name here if you are contributing to the documentation effort in anyway. It will help to ensure we are not duplicating efforts. This is a temporary list until we get the toaster documented.''

Would like to contribute comments to yang / java code

Will be implementing the tool to generate the JavaDoc, which shows how the generated classes are used instead of just describing the model.
