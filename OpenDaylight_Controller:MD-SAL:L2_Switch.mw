=Overview=

This is MD-SAL based implementation of a learning switch with optimizations in how packet is forwarded. 

When a packet comes in, '''L2Switch''' learns about the source's mac address if it doesnt already know about. It then checks if it knows where the target is. If it knows about the target, it ''teleports'' the packet to target. If it doesnt know about the target, it sends a broadcast message on all ''external'' ports in the network.
''Teleporting'' and using '''only''' ''external'' ports for broadcasting is an optimization over "flooding" which typical learning switch would do.

=Assumptions=

#Assumes that hosts don't move i.e a mac address associated with a port on a node does'nt move to another port.
#Assumes LLDP packets are handled by Openflow Plugin. This switch ignores LLDP packets
#Assumes that for non LLDP packets, L2 Switch is the only forwarder of packet. If not, duplicate packets may be forwarded.
#All nodes in the network are openflow capable controlled by the controller.

=Limitation=

# Flow expiration is not handled
# Flow is not updated when host moves (see   [[OpenDaylight Controller:MD-SAL:L2 Switch#Assumptions|Assumptions]] section)
# Flows are not reprogrammed when topology changes

=Switch actions=

Switch only deals with *non lldp* ethernet packets.

| Unknown || Unknown || Learn source, Broadcast packet on all external port minus ingress ||
|-
| Unknown || Known || Learn source, Unicast packet to the target || L2 Switch is essentially ''teleporting'' the packet to the ''node'' where the target is ''attached''. Attachment point is where the target is physically attached.
|-
| Known || Unknown || Broadcast packet on all external ports minus ingress || L2 Switch doesnt need to learn as it already knows the source. There could be case, however, where a host has moved from one node to another node in the network. In the current implementation, we dont update the attachment point.

| Known || Known || Unicast the packet to the target, find the shortest path between source and destination and install mac-to-mac flows on all the nodes in that path||

=Logic choices=
The L2 Switch maintains '''mac-port''' mapping for all mac addresses it learns about. This mapping is a canonical view of the network and not per switch. The ''port'' for a ''mac'' is the ''port'' where the ''mac'' is physically connected (not accounting for a repeater or an external switch scenario but it shouldn't matter there too).
To keep this mapping true, the controller must not receive duplicate packet-in from 2 different switch. 

'''Why?''' Lets say, ARP Request arrives from a host on '''node 1''' at '''port 1'''. The switch doesnt identify the target, so it punts the message to the controller. The controller learns about host and maps it to ''node1:port1''.
Then controller broadcasts the packet on all its ports (minus ingress). Say one of these ports were an ''internal'' port connected to '''port 1''' on '''node 2'''. '''node 2''' will get the packet and say it also doesnt know about the target, it will punt the same message back to controller. Now this time controller will get the message with same source but ingress port as *node2:port1*.

'''The question is, should we update the mapping?'''
If no, since host is *not* really connected at this port, we miss the case when a host genuinely moves to a new location
If yes, then we wont be able to optimally find shortest path between 2 hosts and hence not program flows appropriately.
