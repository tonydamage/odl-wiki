==BGP/LS and PCEP==

==Features==
* First release of BGP protocol library, with basic BGP-MP and Linkstate support
* First release of PCEP protocol library, with base RFC5440, Stateful and Initiated extensions, in two different revisions
* Model-driven protocols, e.g. there are models for each protocol's messages
* Integrated export of gleaned data into MD-SAL

==Non-Code Aspects (user docs, examples, tutorials, articles)==
* [[BGP_LS_PCEP:Hydrogen_Release_Notes|Release Notes]]
* [[BGP_LS_PCEP:User_Guide|User Guide]]
* [[BGP_LS_PCEP:Developer_Guide|Developer Guide]]

==Architectural Issues==
* Architecture needs to be documented in the Developer's guide
* The configuration is non-trivial and while giving the end-user control over the details how the protocols operate, it also means there is a steep learning curve
* There multiple aspects handled by the project, which could probably be restructured (simimar to the openflowjava/openflowplugin split)

==Security Considerations==
* There is no support for any form of session authentication. Both protocols support TCP MD5 authentication, which should be implemented in Helium release.
* North-bound access to data is completely unrestricted and unauthenticated. Data dissemination policies are expected to be defined on the MD-SAL boundary and/or applications
