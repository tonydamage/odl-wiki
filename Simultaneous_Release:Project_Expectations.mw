= Introduction = 

The following outlines what are the required elements from Project Information, Documentation and Testing required from projects to help facilitate the release appropriately.

== Project Information ==

As part of the project definition it is important to know and understand what a project is providing. For example, what sort of add-ons is it contributing to the platform's runtime from library, platform add-on or even external agent or component. Moreover, it should specify where the documentation for this component is located, along with a proposed test plan for this high-level component/feature.

The following is a "sample" metafile which is currently work in progress. The location of this metafile is to be at the root of project repository and any suggestion on improving this file is welcome.

== Packaging ==

From a packaging perspective, projects contribute packages as karaf features. These features can then be directly deployed in container via .kar file extensions or packaged in a distribution specific installable package such as .rpm / .deb add-ons where applicable.

As such it is required that projects create a proper Karaf Feature repository (feature.xml file) for their projects. Please see [Runtime:Karaf_Features_Guidelines] for additional information and guidelines on how to create these feature files.

== Documentation ==

Each project is required to have a local Maven site which is using the opendaylight template (to be provided soon) and is deployed via a jenkins job. This site should have project-specific information targeted to developer level entry into the project's use and consumption. These site will be the reference documentation complementing the "ever changing" wiki format which is providing a less formal documentation.

For additional information on creating a maven site please see: [http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-site.html Maven Site Documentation]
For information on setting up site-deploy for your project please see: [OpenDaylight_Controller:How_To:_Site_Deploy]
