== Introduction ==

== Taking Advantage of Project Infrastructure ==

There is a detailed overview of the [[OpenDaylight_Controller:Development_Infrastructure_Overview | Development Infrastructure ]] that will
give you a good conceptual framework.  Most of what is written here is about concrete getting things done stuff :)


=== Jenkins Setup ===

Each project in OpenDaylight has it's own Jenkins instance which can be found at http://jenkins.opendaylight.org/repo name/ (where repo_name is the name of your repo, for example controller, or vtn, or ovsdb).
or linked off of http://jenkins.opendaylight.org

Each project can decide for itself how it wants to structure its Continuous Integration with Jenkins, but a useful pattern is to have the following 
Jobs:

# '''<projectname>-verify :''' - A Job to run against each patch submitted to Gerrit to automatically 'Verify' that patch prior to code review and consideration for submission.  This Job runs the build and tests to make sure the patch can build and pass existing tests.  [[GettingStarted:Jenkins Verify Job Setup|Jenkins Verify Job Setup]]
# '''<projectname>-merge:''' - A Job to run against master (or some other repo branch) just after a new patch is merged.  This Job reruns the build and tests and publishes artifacts to Nexus. [[GettingStarted:Jenkins Merge Job Setup|Jenkins Merge Job Setup]]
# '''<projectname>-<dependency project name>-integration''' - A Job to run whenever a project you depend on updates its artifacts (ie, it merged a change).  For example, controller depends on yangtools, and so has a controller-yangtools-intergration Job.  [[GettingStarted:Jenkins Integration Job Setup|]
