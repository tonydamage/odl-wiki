*Biography:* Colin has been participating in OpenDaylight since day one
including contributing to 8 projects and routinely handling developer
and user questions to the mailing lists. He actively contributes to the
OpenDaylight_Controller:Main[controller],
Project_Proposals:L2_Switch[l2switch] and Table_Type_Patterns:Main[TTP]
projects. While he has only recently been elected to the TSC as a
committer-at-large, he has attended nearly every TSC meeting and
frequently voiced his opinions and provided suggestions before then. He
also co-authored the
link:Dixon-Erickson OpenDaylight Merged Controller Proposal[Dixon-Erickson
OpenDaylight Merged Controller Proposal], which helped to resolve core
architectural issues in the controller and community early on. He has
spent 10+ years working on networks as a researcher, developer, and
operator on networks at various scales. He has a PhD in networking and
distributed systems from the University of Washington and is passionate
about using open source, software, and SDN to change the way we do
networking.

*Statement of Intent:* As TSC chair, I won't have any power to direct
resources, so I'm not going to promise to get things done, but instead
I'll describe what matters to me in OpenDaylight and where I'll try to
encourage improvement.

* Axioms
** More community is more better.
** More transparency is more better.
** Anyone should be able to easily contribute any code that is in scope.

* Focus Areas
** _Consumability:_ My single biggest focus is on consumability of
OpenDaylight from both a developer and a user perspective. I've pushed
this in many ways including by getting the Simple Forwarding application
to work and route packets by default when OpenDaylight came up in
Hydrogen and painstakingly helping to keep the Eclipse setup
instructions working. The next steps here include improving our
documentation, creating tutorials, and gathering broader developer and
user feedback. Focusing on this will help to grow OpenDaylight's most
valuable assetâ€”our community. +
Interestingly, I think this in and of itself is consumability issue,
where if we can make writing documentation and tutorials easy, most
people will do it as a matter of course.
** _Release Stability:_ The other major focus I want to emphasize at the
moment is making the release process smoother. This is both from the
community/social perspective and from the technical perspective as well
as from both the formal releases and snapshots/weeklies. +
This includes more fleshed out release plans with more concrete
expectations from projects. For example what kind of timely responses
are expected from projects and how to better codify how projects
interact, i.e., provide and consume each other's APIs. +
I also want to encourage us to make it easy for developers to choose
their level of stability, e.g., weekly releases vs. snapshots, as well
as provide easy ways for them to roll back to previous versions either
to find bugs or make progress while bugs are being fixed.
