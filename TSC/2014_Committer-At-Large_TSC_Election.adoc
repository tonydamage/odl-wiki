==== Colin Dixon

image:Colindixon-profile-photo.jpg[Colindixon-profile-photo.jpg,title="Colindixon-profile-photo.jpg"]

*Biography:* Colin has been participating in OpenDaylight since day one
including contributing to 7 projects and routinely handling developer
and user questions to the mailing lists. He actively contributes to the
OpenDaylight_Controller:Main[controller],
Project_Proposals:L2_Switch[l2switch] and Table_Type_Patterns:Main[TTP]
projects. He also co-authored the
link:Dixon-Erickson OpenDaylight Merged Controller Proposal[Dixon-Erickson
OpenDaylight Merged Controller Proposal], which helped to resolve core
architectural issues in the controller and community early on. He has
spent 10+ years working on networks as a researcher, developer, and
operator on networks at various scales. He has a PhD in networking and
distributed systems from the University of Washington and is passionate
about using open source, software, and SDN to change the way we do
networking.

*Statement of Intent:* As a TSC member, I won't have any power to direct
resources, so I'm not going to promise to get things done, but instead
I'll describe what matters to me in OpenDaylight and where I'll try to
encourage improvement.

* Axioms
** More community is more better.
** More transparency is more better.
** Anyone should be able to easily contribute any code that is in scope.

* Focus Areas
** _Consumability:_ My single biggest focus is on consumability of
OpenDaylight from both a developer and a user perspective. I've pushed
this in many ways including by getting the Simple Forwarding application
to work and route packets by default when OpenDaylight came up in
Hydrogen and painstakingly helping to keep the Eclipse setup
instructions working. The next steps here include improving our
documentation, creating tutorials, and gathering broader developer and
user feedback. Focusing on this will help to grow OpenDaylight's most
valuable asset—our community. +
Interestingly, I think this in and of itself is consumability issue,
where if we can make writing documentation and tutorials easy, most
people will do it as a matter of course.
** _Release Stability:_ The other major focus I want to emphasize at the
moment is making the release process smoother. This is both from the
community/social perspective and from the technical perspective as well
as from both the formal releases and snapshots/weeklies. +
This includes more fleshed out release plans with more concrete
expectations from projects. For example what kind of timely responses
are expected from projects and how to better codify how projects
interact, i.e., provide and consume each other's APIs. +
I also want to encourage us to make it easy for developers to choose
their level of stability, e.g., weekly releases vs. snapshots, as well
as provide easy ways for them to roll back to previous versions either
to find bugs or make progress while bugs are being fixed.

Biography

'''''

Mathieu Lemay is CEO of Inocybe Technologies, a company specializing in
Smart & Sustainable IT Infrastructures and CTO of Civimetrix Telecom a
company deploying Open Access Networks. Mathieu has more than 20 years
of experience in information technology. At the age of 10 he was
programming C++, ADA and x86 ASM and then got involved in networking
from the early Bulletin Board Systems to the first commodity Internet.
He earned a Master’s degree in Electrical Engineering with a focus on
Wireless and Optical Telecommunications.

In 2010, Inocybe Technologies, the Communications Research Centre and
École de Technologie Supérieure created the world’s first Zero Carbon
Network, funded by CANARIE, where traffic and compute would move based
on site’s renewable energy’s availability and led to Inocybe’s
involvement in using a modified OpenStack distribution for Green Cloud
operations. Inocybe Technologies is a member of OpenDaylight since June
2013 and Mathieu is currently a committer to the Docs and Reservation
projects.

Statement of Intent

'''''

As a member of the TSC, I want to focus on OpenDaylight's usability from
its modularity to its documentation. While being involved in
OpenDaylight's development I am also an avid consumer of the platform
via my CTO hat. As such I can relate to user needs and expectations. I
also believe that the TSC should encourage and bless best practices
instead of putting negative pressure on committers.

More concretely here are my views in my participation to the community:

* Provide a clear and concrete way for the TSC to have good insights in
projects. As such we are in the process of creating a project explorer
application http://odl-project-explorer.herokuapp.com/features/all[1]
which allows both TSC members and committers to get proper insights in
the projects, their features as well as their test coverage.
* Having studied deeply software engineering metrics (couple of
published papers) I believe code metrics to only be "perceived quality".
As such, I would ratherpropose innovative approaches in grading a
project's quality (i.e. get satisfaction-like voting systems, community
usage profiles, time needed for bug resolution, etc.)
* I will also work to review lifecycle process in light of components /
features based platform as I firmly believe that project-level
lifecycles are too coarse for proper voting and release management.
(i.e. controller has newer features and more established ones)
* I also want to work on incentives for projects to leave the incubation
status.. What would they gain by doing so? Can we have special
privileges for those who do meet it?
* Finally, I want to make sure that OpenDaylight doesn't suffer from
Community paralysis because consensus is always required and
unreachable. (Good example are many standards body which I won't name
and now OpenStack)

However, first and foremost if I am elected I am a representative of the
committers at the TSC and as such I wish to be the voice of any of your
concerns. I want to get to know each and every one of you personally and
have you know that you can count on me in bringing your issues for
discussion to the TSC.

In all transparency, the reason for my late nomination and the downside
in voting for me is that I am extremely busy (I run two companies) but I
will work with the community to have proxies when I am not directly
available to join TSC meetings.

==== Dave Tucker

Dave is a Senior Software Engineer in the Office of the CTO at Red Hat
and a full time OpenDaylight contributor. He has close to 10 years
experience in designing and implementing complex networks and has worked
in various roles from Engineer to Architect, from Consultant to PoC Test
Engineer and even a stint in Technical Marketing. Dave is passionate
about Open Source, Open Standards and using both to create next
generation networks.

Statement of Intent:

As a member of the TSC, Dave is intending to drive the following issues:

* Release Vehicles
** Ensure our RV's are packageable by ditribution maintainers and
manageable by sysadmins
* Simultaneous Release
** Ensure the SR process is as developer-friendly as possible
** Better management of inter-project dependencies
** Create a role for a dedicated Release Manager
** Allow committers to elect a Proejct Lead who will represent the
project for SR
** Use of Bugzilla for Milestone/Dependency Tracking
** 1:1 syncs between project leads and release manager, shorter
cross-project release calls
* Infrastructure
** Getting ODL Forge live ASAP
** Make the infrastructure easily usable for new projects
** Improve cross-project CI including allowing dependent projects to
vote on patches
* Project Lifecycle
** Providing clear guidance/criteria for projects to progress along the
lifecycle
** Actively promoting projects that already meet the defined criteria
* Release Quality
** Code Style - publishing guidelines on what is expected for Java, XML
and Yang
** Code Quality - ensuring that tooling is available to measure Code
Quality (e.g Sonar)
** Documentation - ensuring that tooling is available to measure
documentation coverage (e.g Sonar)

*Statement of Intent*

'''''

*Axiom*

The purpose of the TSC is to support the folks doing the work
(developers,testers, documenters, etc).

*Focus areas*:

* Prioritizing the things which improve the lives of project developers.
* Improved planning of Simultaneous Releases with more community
involvement to insure a smoother more predictable experience for
developers.
* Focusing on the health of the community as a whole across all
projects.
* Fostering greater cross project collaboration.
* Improving the onboarding process for new developers/projects to insure
we continue to have a wellspring of new innovation.
* Improving infrastructure to better support projects by prioritizing
common needs like cloud bursting of Jenkins Instances, shifting to
Jenkins Job Builder and a common master, easy access to project
customized VMs for project test configuration, etc.
