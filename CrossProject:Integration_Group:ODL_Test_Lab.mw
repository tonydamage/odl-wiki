=== OpenDaylight Open Test Lab ===

Similar to the [[CrossProject:Integration_Group:Test_Lab|Ericsson Open Test Lab]] this lab is the framework for Continous Integration Testing out of the [https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/integration Integration Jenkins] build silo.

=== Lab Access ===

Shell access is granted to all Integration team committers. Others needing access may make a request to the [mailto:helpdesk@opendaylight.org OpenDaylight helpdesk] and provided the Integration team committers ok the request access will be granted.

All users will have to be registered with the [https://identity.opendaylight.org OpenDaylight Identity] system and also have configured an SSH pubkey for their account in [https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit Gerrit].

The bridgehead system used to get to the lab allows for port forwarding, if accessing from a Linux, Mac or BSD system you can use [https://github.com/apenwarr/sshuttle sshuttle] for an easy VPN experience. Users on Fedora can install it directly from yum. Ubuntu users may be able to install from apt.

Using sshuttle to connect to the lab

<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
# please replace $ODL_USERNAME with your username known to Gerrit

# Start sshuttle (you will need sudo rights on your system)
sshuttle -r $ODL_USERNAME@testlab.opendaylight.org 172.17.198.24/29 -H --seed-hosts test01,test02,test03,test04,test05

# in another terminal, connect to one of the 5 test systems
ssh $ODL_USERNAME@test01
</syntaxhighlight>

A few notes on sshuttle

* sshuttle runs as root, as such the .ssh/config file read will be the one owned by root
* if you are not using an ssh-agent then the Identity that is used will be read out of root's .ssh/ unless you've made a change to root's .ssh/config file to point use the IdentityFile from a different location
