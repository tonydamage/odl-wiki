= Base Edition Test Plan =
==Prerequisites==
* Start Opendaylight Controller at 10.125.136.52 using Base Edition
* Start mininet (i.e. mininet> sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=10.125.136.52 --topo tree,2)
** This generates 3 nodes: SW1 (*:01), SW2 (*:02), SW3 (*:03)
** SW1 has 2 ports: 1,2 that connects to SW2 and SW3
** SW2 has 3 ports: 1 to host1 (10.0.0.1), 2 to host2 (10.0.0.2) and 3 to SW1
** SW3 has 3 ports: 1 to host3 (10.0.0.3), 2 to host4 (10.0.0.4) and 3 to SW1
