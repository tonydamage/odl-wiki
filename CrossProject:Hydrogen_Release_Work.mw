== Introduction ==

We have a variety of blocking and tackling work that needs to be done to get the Hydrogen Release out the door.

That work is being tracked in a google doc spreadsheet [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoSzir1BfjyWdDQyVElWNG9mcWxhblREckZjbjFxUVE#gid=1 here].

Please consult (and update) the spreadsheet for Activity tracking.

== Daily Cadence Meeting == 

Daily Cadence meetings are happening on the #opendaylight-meeting channel on FreeNode IRC at:

9:00am PST
and
5:45pm PST

You are only expected to attend one of them, not necessarily both.  We have two to accommodate global timezones.
