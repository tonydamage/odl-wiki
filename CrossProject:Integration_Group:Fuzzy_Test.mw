== Introduction ==
The project primarily involves fuzzing various components of OpenDaylight; the end goal being finding as many bugs or exploitable vulnerabilities as possible in the way that OpenDaylight presently implements its interfaces and protocols. Depending on the various fuzzing strategies, OpenDaylight controller will be bombarded with different kinds of fuzz inputs generated by the fuzzing framework. Every instance of OpenDaylight controller will then be monitored for exceptions such as crashes, broken input validations, failing built-in code assertions or for finding potential memory leaks.  Any unusual behavior of any kind shall be analysed and accordingly reported to the community, possibly along with the relevant fixes. 
The framework and the fuzz tests developed will become part of the security test suite in the Integration group.

== Scope ==
The present scope of the project is to fuzz MD-SAL and AD-SAL interfaces.
==== MD-SAL ====
It is required that the fuzzy framework parse and interpret the yang model files and the initial XML configuration of an application, and create a template to be used as an input to the fuzzer.
These fuzzy tests shall therefore test and validate the generated Java code and provider code including the RPC call interface via RestConf API.
==== AD-SAL ====
