== Introduction ==
The project primarily involves fuzzing various components of OpenDaylight; the end goal being finding as many bugs or exploitable vulnerabilities as possible in the way that OpenDaylight presently implements its interfaces and protocols. Depending on the various fuzzing strategies, OpenDaylight controller will be bombarded with different kinds of fuzz inputs generated by the fuzzing framework. Every instance of OpenDaylight controller will then be monitored for exceptions such as crashes, broken input validations, failing built-in code assertions or for finding potential memory leaks.  Any unusual behavior of any kind shall be analysed and accordingly reported to the community, possibly along with the relevant fixes. 
The framework and the fuzz tests developed will become part of the security test suite in the Integration group.

== Scope ==
The present scope of the project is to fuzz MD-SAL and AD-SAL interfaces.
===== MD-SAL =====
It is required that the fuzzy framework parse and interpret the yang model files and the initial XML configuration of an application, and create a template to be used as an input to the fuzzer.
These fuzzy tests shall therefore test and validate the generated Java code and provider code including the RPC call interface via RestConf API.
===== AD-SAL =====

== Progress report == 
''(<small>Updated weekly</small>)
''

===== May 1 - May 18 =====
* Study the ODL architecture, get familiar with the source, community and the overall ecosystem : ''<small>DONE</small>''
* Discussion with mentors on critical fuzz candidates to start with : ''<small>DONE</small>''
:Under the present scope, we'll start with MD-SAL and AD-SAL interfaces, the rest of the fuzz candidates marked as future work.  
===== May 19 - June 8 =====
* Develop the core fuzzing engine : ''<small>DONE</small>''  
:Given a set of fuzz inputs, the fuzzing engine must be able to spawn ODL controller instances using those inputs, monitor each instance for any relevant signals and log all the results for later review and debugging.

''(<small>This is an unofficial section that lists the interesting results obtained from fuzzing so far, for the curious. It shall be updated whenever the author wakes up to something fishy in the logs. A complete, correct and exhaustive list shall of course be put up towards the end.</small>)
