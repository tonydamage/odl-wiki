== Introduction ==
The project primarily involves fuzzing various components of OpenDaylight; the end goal being finding as many bugs or exploitable vulnerabilities as possible in the way that OpenDaylight presently implements its interfaces and protocols. Depending on the various fuzzing strategies, OpenDaylight controller will be bombarded with different kinds of fuzz inputs generated by the fuzzing framework. Every instance of OpenDaylight controller will then be monitored for exceptions such as crashes, broken input validations, failing built-in code assertions or for finding potential memory leaks.  Any unusual behavior of any kind shall be analysed and accordingly reported to the community, possibly along with the relevant fixes. 
The framework and the fuzz tests developed will become part of the security test suite in the Integration group.
