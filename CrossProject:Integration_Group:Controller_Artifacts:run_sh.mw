Main startup script for integration is in distributions/base:
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/gitweb?p=integration.git;a=blob;f=distributions/base/src/assemble/resources/run.sh;hb=HEAD

== Parameter -of13 ==
This parameter is supposed to switch between (old) ''openflow plugin OF-1.0 only'' and (new) openflow plugin ''OF-1.0/1.3''. 
Requirements:
# '''OF-1.0 only''' (default)
#* need osgi filter in order to ignore the ''OF-1.0/1.3'' bundle
#* configSubsystem configuration for ''OF-1.0/1.3'' must NOT be present in configuration/initial folder
# '''OF-1.0/1.3''' (w/ -of13 parameter)
#* need osgi filter in order to ignore the ''OF-1.0 only'' bundle
#* configSubsystem configuration for ''OF-1.0/1.3'' must be present in configuration/initial folder

=== Strategy ===
Config file for '''OF-1.0/1.3''' is copied into '''configuration/initial.available''' by maven assembly plugin. In case it is needed, symbolic link is created in '''configuration/initial'''. Otherwise all symbolic links are wiped out from '''configuration/initial'''.

Also there are osgi filters causing osgi to ignore bundles which match the filter.

=== Corresponding part in script ===
First step is to wipe out all symbolic links from '''configuration/initial'''.
 # clean available optional configurations (links)
 find configuration/initial -type l -exec rm {} \;
Then the default filter is set (in order to ignore ''OF-1.0/1.3'' bundles)
 # OF Filter selection
 OF_FILTER="org.opendaylight.(openflowplugin|openflowjava)"
In case the -of13 paramter is present, filter is changed (in order to ignore ''OF-1.0 only'' bundles) and symbolic links are created
 if (( $OF13 != 0 )); then
     OF_FILTER="org.opendaylight.controller.(thirdparty.org.openflow|protocol_plugins.openflow)"
     while read ofConfig; do
         ln -s ../initial.available/$(basename ${ofConfig}) configuration/initial/
     done < <(find configuration/initial.available -name '*openflowplugin.xml')
 fi
