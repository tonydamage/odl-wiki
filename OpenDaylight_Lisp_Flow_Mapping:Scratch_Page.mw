This is a scratch page for future features and to do items.

To Do/Discuss Features:
* Delete Mappings: design and implement and NB API to delete mapping feature per EID prefix. Options: default to overwrite with inclusion of merge bit to add instead of overwrite, or use TTL = 0 to delete. 
* Associate key with Instance ID as well as EID
* SMR: Options: Feature and NB API to SMR a particular network (EID prefix) with new mappings of a specific EID, 
* Store flows: This requires design or adoption of a flow LCAF
* Differentiate mappings installed from NB vs SB: The delete feature with merge bit may be able to handle this case as well
