This is a scratch page for future features and to do items.

To Do/Discuss Features:

== In Progress or Completed ==

* Delete Mappings: design and implement and NB API to delete mapping feature per EID prefix. Options: default to overwrite with inclusion of merge bit to add instead of overwrite, or use TTL = 0 to delete. 
** So far, default to overwrite is enabled. Merge bit is not implemented.
* SMR: Options: Feature and NB API to SMR a particular network (EID prefix) with new mappings of a specific EID, 
** Completed. add mapping from NB API will send an SMR to all subscribed xTRs for the associated prefix, only if there is a change in the mapping.

== Not Started ==

* Enable integration of LISP SB plugin with GUI and node database
* Associate key with Instance ID as well as EID
* Differentiate mappings installed from NB vs SB: The delete feature with merge bit may be able to handle this case as well
* Store flows: This requires design or adoption of a flow LCAF
