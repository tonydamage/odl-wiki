* '''Southbound Protocol Plugin''' - component which is responsible for handling multiple sessions to southbound network devices and providing common abstracted interface to access various type of functionality provided by these network devices.
* '''Manager-type Application''' - component which is responsible for managing state and configuration of particular functionality which is exposed by southbound protocol plugins
* '''Protocol Library''' - component which is responsible for handling serialization/deserialization between wire protocol format and Java form of protocol
* '''Connector Plugin''' - component which is responsible for connecting consumers (and providers) to Model-driven SAL (and other components) via different wire protocol or set of APIs

Each of this component types exposes different models, uses different subset of MD-SAL functionality and differs in complexity.

==Southbound Protocol Plugin==

Southbound Protocol Plugin is responsible for handling multiple sessions to southbound network devices and providing common abstracted interface to access various type of functionality provided by these network devices.

Southbound Protocol Plugin should be:
  
* '''Stateless''' - only preserved state (which is still transient) is list of connected devices / sessions
* Models mostly use RPCs and Notifications to describe plugin functionality

Example plugins:

* Openflow Southbound Plugin
* Netconf Southbound Plugin
* BGP Southbound Plugin
* PCEP Southbound Plugin

==Manager-type Application==

Manager-type Applications are responsible for providing configuration-like functionality to set / modify behaviour of network elements or southbound plugins,
coordinate flows and provide higher logic on top of stateless southbound plugins.

Manager-type Applications:
* Preserves state
* Models mostly use Configuration Data and Runtime Data to describe component functionality
