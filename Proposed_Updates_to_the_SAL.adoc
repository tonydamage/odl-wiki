[[summary]]
== Summary

This page is a work in progress that tries to document plans to improve
the SAL, specifically that have come out of merging the two controllers.
Some of these updates are more short-term lower hanging fruit and some
of these updates are longer term and will require more discussion.
Hopefully the community will contributes to this page and it will serve
as a check list of current discussion about the SAL and be updated as
discussion points change.

Because understanding the SAL and its capabilities and implications is
itself a work in progress, it is entirely possible that this page
contains errors. Hopefully the community can work together to identify,
confirm, and work around any issues in the SAL.

[[missing-abstractions-to-be-added]]
=== Missing abstractions to be added

* Packet processing pipeline (e.g., that a packet goes to module A,
*then* B, then C)
* OpenFlow 1.x features
** Multiple tables
** Master/Slave notifications between controller and node for HA
** TTL decrement action
* no NextHop action needed for routing protocols like BGP
* Master/Slave notifications inside the controller (for Apps in the
slave node to wake up)

* 6 of the 12 OpenFlow 1.0 match fields (e.g., in_port, outer vlan tag,
vlan_pcp, IP protocol, IP ToS, etc.) I believe these are already
supported:

to relevant java enum].

[[existing-abstractions-to-be-updated]]
=== Existing abstractions to be updated

* To be fixed likely by using the DeviceManager, Device and possibly
AddressSpace implementations from net-virt-platform
** The Host.java does not allow for hosts with multiple IPs or duplicate
MACs needed for multi-tenancy
* To be fixed after a discussion of how to handle "control islands"
** The topology service does not have the notion of SDN vs. non-SDN
islands and the current code implicitly assumes a pure SDN network

[[consistency-assumptions]]
=== Consistency Assumptions

It appears that that SAL makes a number of implicit assumptions about
having strong consistency in the semantics of many of its APIs. While
this assumption may be fine for some deployments (e.g., with a redundant
management network) it is not right for all deployments (e.g., over a
wide area network).

[[event-ordering]]
==== Event Ordering

Event ordering is a thorny problem. If an applications receives a list
of events, e.g., Link DOWN, Link UP, Link DOWN, the application cannot
reliably determine if the final state of the link is DOWN or UP unless
it assumes that the order of events is preserved. Various consistency
assumptions (e.g., eventual consistency) and even the threading model
local to the machine may reorder cause events. For these ordering
sensitive events, we will likely need to re-write parts of the SAL to
use different mechanism to detect event reordering (e.g., vector clocks)
and provide APIs that alert the higher level application that
re-ordering has occurred.

* IListenTopoUpdates
* IDiscoveryService
* IListenInventoryUpdates
* IfHostListener (technically not part of the SAL, but apps seem to
depend on it and tightly coupled with Host.java)
* More? Work in progress

[[partition-recovery]]
==== Partition Recovery

Partition recovery is another thorny problem and is correlated with
event re-ordering. The SAL seems to be written under the assumption that
partitions in the management plane do not happen, but this may not be a
valid assumption in all deployments. Particularly with transactions,
maintaining the precise transaction boundaries during a partition and
ensuring that the recovered state after the partition is resolved
accurately reflects those tranaction boundaries is complicated. For
example, using the SAL Property.java properties, imagine application A
on controller X sets properties Foo=1 and Bar=1 on a Link, but a
partition happens, and application A on controller X sets Foo=1 and
application B on controller Y sets Bar=2 for the same Link. After the
partition is resolved, what are the correct values for Foo and Bar?
Application A expects "Foo=2 and Bar=1" and Application B expects "Foo=1
and Bar=2" -- what is the partition resolver supposed to do? One might
assume the right thing is to set both "Foo=2 and Bar=2", but that might
violate the semantics of the state (e.g., if Foo and Bar were being used
as mutually exclusive locks). We need to be very careful that the
semantics and assumptions of the SAL are well understood and documented.

[[extensibility-requirements]]
=== Extensibility Requirements

In order for the SAL to be successful, it seems that being modular and
extensible are important. More specifically, if the SAL lives in the one
project, another project should be able to extend the SAL's interface
without modifying the code in the SAL's project. While such a mechanism
does not yet exist, proposals are starting to emerge:
