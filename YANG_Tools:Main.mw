YANG Tools is a infrastructure project aiming to develop necessary tooling and libraries providing support of NETCONF and YANG for Java (JVM-language based) projects and applications, such as Model Driven SAL for Controller (which uses YANG as it's modeling language) and Netconf / OFConfig plugins.

Project contains YANG related artefacts such as binding specification to Java, YANG parser and semantic model and Maven plugin for processing 
YANG files.

=== Code Generator ===

=== RestConf ===

==Models==

==Contribute==

YANG Tools project is open to contributions and we would appreciate your help with:

* Generation of DSDL (RelaxNG) based on RFC6110
* Generation of YIN representation (RFC6020)
** compile time (using custom generator for YANG Maven Tools)
** runtime (transforming org.opendaylight.yangtools.yang.model.* classes to their YIN representation in XML DOM)
* Implementation of validation of instance data (XML) based on YANG to RelaxNG mapping - RFC6110
* Bugfixes, code reviews
* Documentation
* Example generators
* Testing with various YANG modules and models

If you are interested feel free to contact as at [https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/yangtools-dev/ yangtools-dev] mailing list
