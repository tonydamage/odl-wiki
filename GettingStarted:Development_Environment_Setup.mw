__TOC__ 

= Overview =
This page is intended to help developers get started on setting up their development environment, specifically links to operating systems, tools and utilities that prove useful during development.

= Quick Start =
If you are looking for a quick start, consider downloading one of the Fedora VMs located on the [http://www.opendaylight.org/software/downloads downloads] page of the OpenDaylight project, specifically the Techtorial Fedora VM.

= Manual Set Up =

The remainder of this guide discusses how to set up the development environment using Fedora (linux) environment.

#Download and Install [https://fedoraproject.org/ Fedora]
#Download and install the Java JDK (version 1.7 seems to be the supported version for ODL at this point).
#Download and install [http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi maven]
#*Once you have downloaded and unzipped maven, I found it handy to create a symbolic link to mvn from the /usr/bin directory so mvn can be found in your path without having to modify the path variable. To set the symbolic link you can use this command:   <br> ln -s /opt/maven/bin/mvn /usr/bin/mvn <br> ''Assumes maven was extracted to /opt/''
#*Edit your .bashrc file to set default maven options to increase the amount of memory used for compiling.
#*#vi ~/.bashrc
#*#Add          export MAVEN_OPTS='-Xmx1048m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m'    <br>''Note, you can increase the heap space, the -Xmx setting, to greater that 1G if memory is available. When building in maven, the max memory reached will be displayed at the end of the build. You can use this as a guide to determine if more memory would help decrease build times.''
#Install GIT. One of the great advantages of using linux is yum (supported by some linux distributions, such as Fedora) :). To install GIT, run the following YUM command:
#*yum install curl-devel expat-devel gettext-developenssl-devel zlib-devel
#Install wireshark - Wireshark is utility use for capturing individual packets between devices. Again, using yum, install wireshark:
#*yum install wireshark-gnome
#Finally, continue your environment set up by following the next steps outline on the [[GettingStarted:Developer Main|Getting Started]] page.
''Note: If you find there are missing tools or utilities that are required for a develop to get started, please add them to the list!''
