__TOC__ 

= Overview =
This page is intended to help developers get started on setting up their development environment, specifically links to operating systems, tools and utilities that prove useful during development.

= Quick Start =
If you are looking for a quick start, consider downloading one of the Fedora VMs located on the [http://www.opendaylight.org/software/downloads downloads] page of the OpenDaylight project, specifically the Techtorial Fedora VM.

= Manual Set Up =

The remainder of this guide discusses how to set up a development environment in Fedora Linux.

* Download and Install [https://fedoraproject.org/en/get-fedora Fedora]
* Download and install the Java JDK (version 1.7 seems to be the supported version for ODL at this point)
 sudo yum install java-1.7.0-openjdk-devel
* Download and install [http://maven.apache.org/ maven]
 sudo yum install maven
* Optional: Edit your ~/.bashrc (or perhaps ~/.zshrc) file to increase the amount of RAM maven uses when compiling
 vi ~/.bashrc
Add the following:
 export MAVEN_OPTS='-Xmx1048m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m'
''Note, you can increase the heap space, the -Xmx setting, to greater than 1G if memory is available. When building in maven, the max memory reached will be displayed at the end of the build. You can use this as a guide to determine if more memory would help decrease build times.''
* Install Git
 sudo yum install git
* Optional: Install Wireshark (packet capture tool, useful for debugging)
 sudo yum install wireshark
* Finally, continue your environment set up by following the next steps outline on the [[GettingStarted:Developer Main|Getting Started]] page

''Note: If you find there are missing tools or utilities that are required for a develop to get started, please add them to the list!''
