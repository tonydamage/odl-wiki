== Introduction ==
The library is designed for the robot framework to implement flexible and readable test case. The design is following google's [http://robotframework.googlecode.com/hg/doc/userguide/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#creating-test-libraries recommendation] style.

You can try the latest code from the [https://github.com/yeasy/robot_tool Github] or the stable code from the [https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/admin/projects/integration integration git repo].

== Get Code ==
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/yeasy/robot_tool.git
</pre>

== Usage ==
===Prerequisites===
* Python 2.6/2.7
* Python [https://github.com/bulkan/robotframework-requests Roboframework-requests library]
 <pre>
  pip install -U robotframework-requests
</pre>
* [https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/GettingStarted:Developer_Main OpenDaylight Controller]
Download and build OpenDaylight Controller

<pre>
   git clone https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/p/controller.git
   cd controller/opendaylight/distribution/opendaylight
   mvn clean install -DskipTests -Dmaven.compile.fork=true -U
</pre>
* [http://mininet.org/walkthrough Mininet]
* [http://robotframework.org Robotframework]

===Run Test===
* Start the [https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/GettingStarted:Developer_Main OpenDaylight Controller]
<pre>
  cd controller/target/distribution.opendaylight-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-osgipackage/opendaylight/
  ./run.sh
</pre>
* Start mininet, and make sure mininet has all switches connected to the controller, for example, 
<pre>sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=your_controller_ip --topo tree,2</pre>
*  Go to the suites directory, executing the suite such as 'pybot base' which will run all tests in the base edition or 'pybot switch_manager.txt' to test the switch manager module.
