== Introduction ==
The library is designed for the robot framework to implement flexible and readable test case. The design is following google's [http://robotframework.googlecode.com/hg/doc/userguide/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#creating-test-libraries recommendation] style.

You can try the latest code from the [https://github.com/yeasy/robot_tool Github] or the stable code from the [https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/admin/projects/integration integration git repo].

During developing this tool, we find and fix [https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=153 bug 153].

== Get Code ==
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/yeasy/robot_tool.git
</pre>
The stable version can be pulled by
 <pre> git clone https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/integration </pre>

== Usage ==
===Prerequisites===
* Python 2.6/2.7
<pre>
aptitude install python2.7
</pre>
* [https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/GettingStarted:Developer_Main OpenDaylight Controller]
Download and build OpenDaylight Controller

<pre>
   git clone https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/p/controller.git
   cd controller/opendaylight/distribution/opendaylight
   mvn clean install -DskipTests -Dmaven.compile.fork=true -U
</pre>
* [http://mininet.org/walkthrough Mininet]
<pre>
aptitude install mininet
</pre>
* [http://robotframework.org Robotframework]
<pre>
pip install robotframework
</pre>

===Run Test===
* Start the [https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/GettingStarted:Developer_Main OpenDaylight Controller]
<pre>
  cd controller/target/distribution.opendaylight-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-osgipackage/opendaylight/
  ./run.sh
</pre>
* Start mininet, and make sure mininet has all switches connected to the controller, for example, 
<pre>sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=your_controller_ip --topo tree,2</pre>
*  Go to the suites directory, executing the suite such as 
<pre>pybot  -v CONTROLLER:127.0.0.1 base                  #Run all tests in the base suite 
OR
pybot -v CONTROLLER:127.0.0.1 arp_handler.txt     #Test the arp handler module.
</pre>

==Hack Code==
===Create and Import Library===
The robotframework supports both Python and Java based library. Here we take the Python code for example.

The library can be either a normal module or a class (Commonly a *.py file). You can add the ''Library    your_library_file'' command into the ''*** Settings ***'' part to import a library. Notice the elements (variable, keyword, etc) separator in robot script is tab (or four spaces), instead of space. Space is only used inside the name of the same element.

===Add Keyword===
In case of a module, a keyword will be created for each top-level function in the module. In case of a class, a keyword will be created for each public method of the class.

Keyword name will be mapped to the function name (case insensitively and underscores removed), and the keywords will have same arguments as the functions. For example, if you define a function in the library as
<pre>
def print_hello_world(param1,param2):
    """
    Just print out the first hello to the world.
    """
    print "Hello world",param1,param2
</pre>
Then after import the library, you can use the keyword in the robot framework as
<pre>
$param1    Hi
$param2    Again
Print Hello World     ${param1}    ${param2}
</pre>

===Example Case===
Some useful basic functions are defined in ''libraries/Common.py'' library.
You can see the code to find a ''collection_should_contain'' function (check if a collection should contain every given member) like
<pre>
import collections
def collection_should_contain(collection, *members):
    """
    Fail if not every members is in the collection.
    """
    if not isinstance(collection, collections.Iterable):
        return False
    for m in members:
        if m not in collection:
            return False
    else:
        return True
</pre>
Then we can use the keyword ''Collection Should Contain'' after importing the library as
`Library           ../../libraries/Common.py`.
For example, in the switch_manager.txt robot script.
<pre>
Collection Should Contain    ${nodes}    ${topo_nodes}
</pre>

===Learning More===
Would like to suggest to read the [http://code.google.com/p/robotframework/wiki/PythonTutorial Python Tutorial for robotframework] and the [http://code.google.com/p/robotframework/wiki/UserGuide Robot Framework User Guide].
