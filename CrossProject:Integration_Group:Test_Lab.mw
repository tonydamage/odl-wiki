== Open Test Lab ==
The framework for Continuous System Integration Test will be hosted in existing OpenDaylight servers, in the meantime Ericsson offers a test environment that can be used for:

* Get familiar with controller (DUT)
* Evaluate test tools
* Debug system test code

This is current Lab topology:

=== Lab Access ===

Lab access is provided through SSH server with public key authentication. Please follow the steps bellow:
* Generate a public key in the SSH client and mail it to luis.gomez@ericsson.com along with your username.
* Once the key gets provisioned in the SSH server, do: '''ssh username@server2.verkstad.net (129.192.170.80)'''. In case of authentication problems please contact luis.gomez@ericsson.com
* The SSH server allows SSH forwarding (SSH tunnels) so you can configure a many as you need (example to forward VNC: ssh -L 15900:10.125.136.37:5900 alias@server2.verkstad.net)
* Before start using the Lab, please BOOK the time [[CrossProject:Integration_Group:Lab_Schedule|'''here''']].
* The VM images have 2 intefaces: one for operation (external access) and one for traffic. Please use the second for doing test.
