==Project Name: OpenDOVE==
===Components===
====oDMC (OpenDove Management Controller)====
This component, packaged as part of the virtualization edition of OpenDaylight, provides both a control and
access point into the OpenDOVE management plane.
====oDCS (OpenDove Connectivity Server)====
This component, packaged as an rpm in the supporting VM, provides the control point for the OpenDOVE control plane.
====oDGW (OpenDove Gateway)====
Provides gateway functionality (encap/decap/NAT) between the overlay and the outside world.  It is packaged as an rpm in the supporting VM.
====OVS-Agent (OpenDove OVS Agent)====
Provides interface between OVS and OpenDove control plane. It is packaged as an rpm in the supporting VM

==Features==

* Network virtualization: the ability to create isolated networks for subsets of hosts
* Connectivity policy: the ability to define whether isolated networks should be able to communicate with each other
* External connectivity: the ability to allow isolated networks to talk to the outside world via static routes, SNAT, or DNAT

==Non-Code Aspects (user docs, examples, tutorials, articles)==

Your project / feature should be included in the appropriate [[Release/Hydrogen|Hydrogen Release Guides and Documentation]]:
* [[Open_Dove:Installation|Installation Guide(s)]]
* [[Open_Dove:How_To_Use|User Guide(s)]]
* [[Open_DOVE:Developer Pages|Developer Guide(s)]]
* [[Open_DOVE:API|OpenDove APIs]]

==Architectural Issues==

None known.

==Security Considerations==

None known.

==Quality Assurance (test coverage, etc)==

Open DOVE has been extensively tested via manual configuration of virtual networks and "canary in the coal mine"-style tests. Automated integration testing was inhibited by the complexity of managing multiple VMs to act as the network. These tests an unit testing are a target for the next release.

==End-of-life (API/Features EOLed in Release)==

This is the first release of Open DOVE, so no features have been EOLed.

==Bugzilla (summary of bug situation)==
==Standards (summary of standard compliance)==

* Open DOVE implements the VXLAN packet encapsulation format, but not the VXLAN control plane.

==Schedule (initial schedule and changes over the release cycle)==

* At the moment, we will not be able to release the Open DOVE Gateway for non-technical reasons. We hope to resolve this issue soon.
