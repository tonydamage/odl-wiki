== Introduction ==

This page is intended for folks who are presenting OpenDaylight to various groups to post who they are, when they have (or will present) and
the slides they use to facilitate slide sharing :)

== Basic Collateral ==

The OpenDaylight Foundation maintains a basic [http://www.opendaylight.org/resources/collateral collateral deck], which they keep up to date.  Its a good place to 
start, and you should also pull the membership slide from it as they keep it up to date.

== Historical Presentations ==

Note: This is not claiming to be complete as its kept up by presenters voluntarily reporting (please try to maintain date order):
