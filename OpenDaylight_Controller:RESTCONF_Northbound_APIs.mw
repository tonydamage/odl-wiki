The MD-SAL northbound APIs are rendered in run-time from yang models according to the [http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-bierman-netconf-restconf/ RESTCONF] specification. Yang models are used in MD-SAL and MD-SAL-based applications to define all APIs: inter-component APIS, plugin APIs,  and some models are used to define the controller's northbound APIs.
