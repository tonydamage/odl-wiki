Yang models are used in the MD-SAL and in MD-SAL-based applications to define all APIs: inter-component APIs, plugin APIs, northbound APIs, etc. Yang models are used to generate Java APIs at compile time with [[YANG Tools:Main|OpenDaylight Yang Tools]] and to render REST APIs at run time according to the [http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-bierman-netconf-restconf/ RESTCONF] specification. Plugins designed for MD-SAL define yang models for their northbound APIs, which are then exposed to applications as REST APIs via a RESTCONF adapter.


The following MD-SAL northbound APIs are currently available:
* '''Inventory''':
** [https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/controller/job/controller-merge/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/opendaylight/md-sal/model/model-inventory/target/site/models/opendaylight-inventory.html Top-Level Inventory]: list of all nodes known to the controller 
** [https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/controller/job/controller-merge/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/opendaylight/md-sal/model/model-flow-service/target/site/models/flow-node-inventory.html OpenFlow Nodes]: extends the top-level inventory node with OF-specific features that allow retrieving and programming of OF-specific state, such as ports, tables, flows, etc.

* '''Topology''':
** [https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/yangtools/job/yangtools-merge/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/model/ietf/ietf-topology/target/site/restconf/network-topology.html Base Topology]: list of all topologies known to the controller. Topologies can be of different types (L3 unicast, IS-IS, OSPF, OF), but they all share the common base type defined here. 
** [https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/yangtools/job/yangtools-merge/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/model/ietf/ietf-topology-l3-unicast-igp/target/site/restconf/l3-unicast-igp-topology.html L3 unicast IGP topology]: extends the Base topology with attributes common to all link-state IGPs. 
** [https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/yangtools/job/yangtools-merge/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/model/ietf/ietf-topology-isis/target/site/restconf/isis-topology.html IS-IS topology]: extends L3 unicast IGP topology with attributes specific to IS-IS
** [https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/yangtools/job/yangtools-merge/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/model/ietf/ietf-topology-ospf/target/site/restconf/ospf-topology.html OSPF topology]: extends L3 unicast IGP topology with attributes specific to OSPF
** [https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/yangtools/job/yangtools-merge/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/model/ietf/ietf-ted/target/site/restconf/ted.html Traffic Engineering Database (TED)]: extends L3 unicast IGP topology with Traffic engineering attributes

* '''BGP''':
**[https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/bgpcep/job/bgpcep-nightly/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/staging/bgp-parent/bgp-rib-api/bgp-rib.html Access to BGP Loc-RIB]
** [https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/bgpcep/job/bgpcep-nightly/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/staging/bgp-parent/bgp-linkstate/bgp-linkstate.html Access to BGP-LS NLRI/Attribute data]

* [https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/bgpcep/job/bgpcep-nightly/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/staging/pcep-parent/pcep-tunnel-api/topology-tunnel-pcep-programming.html '''PCEP tunnel programming''']
