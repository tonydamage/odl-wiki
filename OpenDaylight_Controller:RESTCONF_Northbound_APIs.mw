Yang models are used in MD-SAL and MD-SAL-based applications to define all APIs: inter-component APIs, plugin APIs, northbound APIs, etc. Yang models are used to generate Java APIs at compile time with [[YANG Tools:Main|OpenDaylight Yang Tools]] and to render REST APIs at run time according to the [http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-bierman-netconf-restconf/ RESTCONF] specification. Plugins designed for MD-SAL define yang models for their northbound APIs, which are then exposed to applications as REST APIs via a RESTCONF adapter.


The following MD-SAL northbound APIs are currently available:
* Inventory:
** [https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/controller/job/controller-merge/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/opendaylight/md-sal/model/model-inventory/target/site/models/opendaylight-inventory.html Top-Level Inventory]: a tree of all nodes known to the controller 
** [https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/controller/job/controller-merge/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/opendaylight/md-sal/model/model-flow-service/target/site/models/flow-node-inventory.html OpenFlow Nodes]: extends the top-level inventory nodes with OF-specific features that allows retrieving and programming of OF-specific state, such as ports, tables, flows, etc.

* Topology:
* BGP:
**[https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/bgpcep/job/bgpcep-nightly/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/staging/bgp-parent/bgp-rib-api/bgp-rib.html Access to BGP Loc-RIB]
** [https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/bgpcep/job/bgpcep-nightly/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/staging/bgp-parent/bgp-linkstate/bgp-linkstate.html Access to BGP-LS NLRI/Attribute data]
* [https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/bgpcep/job/bgpcep-nightly/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/staging/pcep-parent/pcep-tunnel-api/topology-tunnel-pcep-programming.html PCEP tunnel programming]

The complete list of yang models currently used in MD-SAL and MD-SAL based plugins (OpenFlow 1.0/1.3, BGP/PCEP, Netconf) can be found [[YANG_Tools:Available_Models|here]].
